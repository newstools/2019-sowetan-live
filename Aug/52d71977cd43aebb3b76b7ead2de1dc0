Kaizer Chiefs have confirmed their fifth signing ahead of the 2019/2020 season. Amakhosi have welcomed left-back Yagan Sasman, who is also comfortable in central defence. The 23-year-old joins as a free agent following the expiry of his contract with Ajax Cape Town. Sasman had been with Chiefs for the past couple of weeks and was being assessed. He's now on a three-year contract. He's Chiefs' fifth signing after they also roped in Lazarous Kambole, Kearyn Baccus, James Kotei and Samir Nurkovic. Sasman is a direct replacement for Teenage Hadebe, who has left to join Turkish side Yeni Malatyaspor. Not only are they both left- footed, but Hadebe - a natural centre-back - could also play on the left. It appears that the move was meant to be for Sasman, because he joined Chiefs on July 10 - his birth date - to begin his assessment. Sasman left Ajax after 12 years with the Mother City club, dating back to his development days. He will fight for a starting spot with the likes of Daniel Cardoso, Mulomowandau Mathoho, Siyabonga Ngezana and Lorenzo Gordinho in the centre of defence, while he will have to contend with Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya and Happy Mashiane  at the left-back.
