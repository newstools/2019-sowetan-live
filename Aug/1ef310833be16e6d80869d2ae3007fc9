After 25 years of democracy, the ethical and moral issues around displaying the apartheid-era flag can finally be put to rest. This comes after the Equality Court declared the gratuitous display of the apartheid flag as hate speech. The news has made waves on social media, with many welcoming the long overdue decision. Public figures, including former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela have also weighed in on the matter. Other Twitter users also expressed their happiness over the decision, some giving us life with their humourous take on the landmark decision. For some, the decision came decades too late. While discussions around use of the flag have largely been divisive and seen as drawn along racial lines, some tweeps reminded us why as a country we have come far and should continue to embrace each other.
