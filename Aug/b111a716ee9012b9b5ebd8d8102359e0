Red Bull is paying out unhappy customers who feel the company falsely promised them wings after drinking the energy drink. Newsweek reports that Michael Attar, a Canadian, filed the lawsuit in 2016, claiming Red Bull made false declarations regarding the usefulness of its products. Red Bull has agreed to pay $850,000 CAD (almost R10m) in a settlement for the class-action lawsuit. Only Canadian energy drinkers will benefit from this victory: those who bought a can of Red Bull between January 1 2007 and July 23 2019 could be entitled to $10 CAD. October 14 is the deadline to register on a website created to facilitate the payments. - TimesLIVE
