Today,  the late Whitney Houston would’ve turned  56 . Known for hits such as I will always love you and I wanna dance with somebody among a plethora of chart-toppers, Whitney was a force to be reckoned with, both behind the mic and offstage. Although her private life was riddled with scandals and drug addiction, Whitney always managed to rise like a phoenix. In 2009, after a long hiatus , Whitney reclaimed her title as Queen of the Charts when her comeback album, I look to you sold 304,000 copies in its debut week. To honour the legend, we’ve rounded up five of our favourite quotes from Whitney about self-love and owning your power as a woman. Women in showbiz are often called divas when they command respect in a male-dominated industry. In an interview she did in 1999, Whitney denounced this title while she honoured other phenomenal women in the music industry like Missy Elliot and Lauryn Hill. We love a queen who changes the narrative of patriarchal anecdotes! Even in the early days of her career, she was already leaving journalists in awe of her prowess. In an interview with Time magazine she spoke about how she wears the pants in a ‘man’s world’. In her rendition of George Benson’s 1977 hit, The greatest love of all, Whitney teaches us that self-love is the most  important encounter one can  experience and this is the message we’re sending out to all the women out there this month and every other day of the year. Come home to yourself, Queen! One of the most important facets of self-love is holding yourself accountable and we love how Whitney was so aware of the power that lies within her. Pictures are the visual evidence of self-expression and love. Whitney knew this and there are  many pictures of her that attest to her star power, grace and timeless beauty.
