If you’re expecting to have your debts written off now that the debt relief bill has been signed into law, don’t. There’s no commencement date for the controversial legislation, and even if applications were open and you were found to be eligible for it, you won’t necessarily have your debts extinguished or even suspended. Instead, you might be placed in a form of debt review administered by the National Credit Regulator (NCR). The debt relief intervention that forms part of an amendment to the National Credit Act seeks to help you if you are overindebted, earn less than R7,500 a month and have unsecured debt of no more than R50,000. This is what you need to know about it: Magolego says that the extinguishing of debt will take place for a limited period of 48 months only, after which there will be an impact assessment to determine its efficacy and whether or not it should become a permanent feature of the law.
