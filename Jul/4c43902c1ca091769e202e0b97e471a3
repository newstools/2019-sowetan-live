Quick-thinking by an employee at the Sky City Mall in Kliprivier led to two armed robbers being locked in a walk-in safe before police arrested them. Gauteng police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini said the employee who works at one of the retail stores in the mall managed to prevent the suspects from succeeding with the robbery on Sunday evening. "We commend the employee who was able to bravely act in such a dangerous scene and help police nab the suspects," said Dlamini. He said police also recovered a firearm which the robbers allegedly used to shoot at the door of the safe which failed to open. "The suspects were part of a gang that terrorised employees and the public at the mall." He said the other suspects managed to escape in a getaway vehicle and left their accomplices behind. A manhunt has since been launched. Dlamini said members of the K9 flying squad and local police went to the complex and surrounded the area when they heard that the suspects were trapped inside. "They managed to arrest the suspects who were found confined in the walk-in safe with the money on them. "The suspects were slightly injured during arrest but were taken to Sebokeng Hospital and are under police guard," Dlamini said. The suspects will be charged with attempted murder, business robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Dlamini also said the suspects are being profiled as they might be part of a gang that is involved in serious and violent crimes, including business robberies and hijackings in the province. The arrested suspects are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge magistrate's court today.
