Just like that, we’re six month away from December! We wrapped up Youth Month this past weekend and it seems our celebs were living their best lives. From a birthday party filled with bubbles, a packed one man show, to sight-seeing in style. Here’s how your fave celebs bid farewell to June.

We stan a Queen who parties and works hard at the same time! DJ Shimza had his one man show on Saturday and boy did he pull out a crowd! He even dropped a new single at the sold-out event and it seems house heads have a new addition to their playlists.
