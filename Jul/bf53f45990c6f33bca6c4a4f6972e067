Amanda du-Pont just minds her own business, collects her coins and treats herself to life – we can’t help but stan! While we’re knee-deep in the dead of winter, the jet-setting actress has been chasing summer with the love of her life. Fresh off a magical vacay in Europe with her fiance, Shawn Rodriques, the couple decided basking in more sun is the way to go and headed to the tropical island Mauritius. Amanda is living our Dezemba mood in July by basking in the sun and enjoying beautiful views in the private resort, Le Saint Géran. Waking up in one of the most beautiful islands in the world, and looking like the esteemed guest you are must be such a vibe. If Childish Gambino’s Feels like summer had a poster child, it would be Amanda in this snap. Clearly everyday is  beach day when you’re in Mauritius at the best time of the year (from May to December)! Strolling in some of the best beaches in Africa and enjoying sunny days with the love of her life, Amanda is living! Are you even on an African island if you don’t do something deeply connected to nature and wildlife? Also, peep how comfy and effortlessly cool Amanda’s hiking ‘fit is?! The caption of this photo made us feel warm and fuzzy inside because Amanda's fiance proposed to her in a similar setting last year: a secluded island. Love is beautiful!
