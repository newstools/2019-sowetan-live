Having just signed four players so far, Kaizer Chiefs could still spring some surprises in the current transfer market. So far, Amakhosi have recruited Zambian marksman, Lazarus Kambole, midfielder James Kotei from Ghana, Serbian striker Samir Nukorvic and another midfielder Kearyn Baccus, who was born in Durban but relocated to Australia when he was very young. Speaking at the Carling Black Label Cup logistics media conference at FNB Stadium yesterday, Chiefs spokesperson Vina Maphosa gave an impression that the Soweto club were not yet done in the market yet. The transfer window closes at the end of August. "We've signed only four players, but any time is tea time, especially considering that the window period will only close at the end of next month," Maphosa declared. Chiefs have been linked to a number of local players such Bidvest Wits midfield workhorse Thabang Monare and TS Galaxy ace Nation Ndlovu, among others. Heading into their Carling Black Label Cup tie against arch-rivals Orlando Pirates, the Glamour Boys are still reeling from their 2-1 defeat at the hands of Botswana side Township Rollers over the weekend. Meanwhile, Stadium Management managing director, Bertie Grobbelaar has warned fans against coming with counterfeit tickets on match day. "If any person is found in possession of fake tickets and trying to sell them, that person will be arrested. And we'll insist on prosecution. Moreover, we urge the supporters to arrive early," Grobbelaar said. Public transportation will be made available through Metrorail, BRT, Top6 Taxis, KTK Shuttles and Rea Vaya to and from the venue. Free parking is available for all patrons attending the derby using their own transport, organisers said in a statement. "Strict traffic control measures will be implemented from 7am in the precinct and the general public [non-spectators] should avoid the Stadium precinct from 10am until 7pm."
