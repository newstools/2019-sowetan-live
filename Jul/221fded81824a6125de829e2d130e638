Kaizer Chiefs continues to beef up their squad for the coming Absa Premiership season with the signing of Kearyn Byron Baccus from Melbourne City FC in the Australia A-League on Friday. The 27-year old has penned a three year deal with Amakhosi. After failing to qualify for the MTN8 next season‚ Amakhosi have embarked on a rebuilding exercise and the little known Baccus becomes the fourth arrival at Naturena. “Kaizer Chiefs would like to confirm the arrival of Kearyn Byron Baccus‚” the club said in a statement. The 27-year old midfielder‚ who was born in Durban‚ has spent most of his life in Australia after his family moved there when he was eight. “The Durban-born midfielder lands in Naturena from Australia where he played for Melbourne City FC in the A-League. The 27-year old has penned a three year deal with Amakhosi.” Chiefs finished ninth in the league last season and then suffered further embarrassment when they lost 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup final to TS Galaxy who became the first-ever National First Division (NFD) winners of the season-ending knockout trophy. Some of the notable players who have been signed by Amakhosi already during the off-season are Lazalous Kambole from Zesco United in Zambia‚ Ghanaian midfielder James Kotei from Simba FC in Tanzania and Serbian striker Samir Nurković.
