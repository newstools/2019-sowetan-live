Seven-time champion Serena Williams moved to within one win of equalling Margaret Courtâ€™s record of 24 Grand Slam titles on Thursday when she reached her 11th Wimbledon final. The 37-year-old American, seeded 11, eased past over-matched Barbora Strycova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-2 in the semi-finals. She will face Simona Halep for the title on Saturday after the seventh seed became the first Romanian woman to reach the Wimbledon final with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Elina Svitolina. Williams has a 9-1 career lead over Halep.
