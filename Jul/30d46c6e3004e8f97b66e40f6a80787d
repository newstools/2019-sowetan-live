The City of Johannesburg said on Wednesday  it would be intensifying its fight against  attacks on its medics and the hijackings of their vehicles. It said it had identified  six troublesome areas to which police would now escort medical staff: Since the beginning of January, there have been more than 10 incidents in which medics have been attacked. The city's David Tembe said two recent incidents took place in Cosmo City extension 2 in Roodepoort and  in Dobsonville, Soweto. "On June 27 2019, EMS responded to a domestic incident in  Dobsonville.  While the crew was busy treating the patient inside the ambulance, two gunmen opened the ambulance doors and robbed the crew off their belongings." "On  June 29 2019, an ambulance was dispatched to an assault case in Cosmo City extension 2, where [medics]  found an adult male patient who  had apparently been assaulted. The community became hostile and began to assault  the crew and the patient." To curb these incidents, the city will  partner with the police when responding to emergency calls between 10pm and 6am.
