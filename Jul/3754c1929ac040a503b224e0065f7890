Competition for starting spots in the middle of the park is one the factors that motivated Fortune Makaringe to join Orlando Pirates. Before eventually penning a deal with Pirates from Maritzburg United, Makaringe, 26, was earmarked by a number of other local clubs such as Bucs' huge rivals Kaizer Chiefs, who they face in the Carling Black Label Cup at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3pm). "It was not an easy decision [to choose Pirates over other clubs]. Competition is always there, that's why I responded when Pirates contacted me," said Makaringe. The former Maritzburg midfield kingpin faces stiff competition from the likes of Xola Mlambo, Musa Nyatama, Ben Motshwari and Linda Mntambo. "I knew I was going to be up against the best footballers in this country, so this is a challenge for me to come and learn from them, to become one of the best. To be the best, you need to play alongside the best. "I believe that Fortune is coming with fortunes," the animated Makaringe quipped.

I had to understand that not everyone was going to go with the team." The lad from Vosloorus, on the East Rand, feels being at Pirates will enhance his chances of being a Bafana asset in future. "If you're doing well at a club like Pirates, you definitely get a call-up, so definitely being here at Pirates will boost my opportunities to play for Bafana," he said.
