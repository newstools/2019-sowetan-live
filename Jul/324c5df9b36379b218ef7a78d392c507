Former Zambia international striker Collins Mbesuma has found a new home at Pretoria University. Mbesuma has continued to show he has no immediate plans of retiring after signing with the university side popularly known as AmaTuks. The 35-year-old continues to have value in the National First Division (NFD) after playing a big role with Maccabi FC, for whom he scored 10 goals in 22 appearances, last season. "I arrived on Monday and I am glad to be here at Tuks. It's a good move for me because I still have a lot to offer," Mbesuma told Sowetan in a brief chat. "I am looking forward to helping the team achieve their goals..." After a colourful career with Kaizer Chiefs, the Zambian hitman had become a nomad in recent seasons, going through clubs such as Highlands Park and Mpumalanga Black Aces.
