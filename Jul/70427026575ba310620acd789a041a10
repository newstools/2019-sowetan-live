It was a cheek-wiping moment as James Small's children, Ruby and Caleb, stood on the field at Ellis Park as the Boks ran out to Johnny Clegg's Impi. The former Springbok died of a suspected heart attack on July 10, while the Grammy nominee died after a battle with pancreatic cancer on July 16. Sports presenter Minnie Dlamini-Jones was the official flag bearer and shared a heartwarming message on Twitter about the moment with Small's children. "I stood with #JamesSmall's kids as we sang the national anthem. Two of the strongest and bravest kids who stood in front of the world days after losing their dad."
