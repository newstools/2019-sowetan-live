On Monday, former president Jacob Zuma began his testimony before the commission of inquiry into state capture. Zuma is expected to deliver an opening address before he receives questions from the commission. Proceedings started with his lawyer, Muzi Sikhakhane, saying his client "will connect his own dots". In a brief statement to deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo, Sikhakhane said they, as his lawyers, have not had an opportunity to consult Zuma about the nature of his testimony or whether he might "oust" or implicate certain parties.
