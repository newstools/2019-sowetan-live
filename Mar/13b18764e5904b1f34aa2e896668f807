Cape Town City's Thato Mokeke has reflected on his good start with the team since arriving in January. From the disappointment of parting ways with Chippa United to the joy of securing a deal with the Citizens, the 28-year-old has established himself as a regular in Benni McCarthy's side. He's played 90 minutes in each of the 11 league and cup matches that he's featured in. "When you come in, you need to add value and you cannot just come and just [add to the numbers]," said Mokeke, who's in his second stint with the Mother City club. "I think there's an improvement to my game compared to the last time I was here . luckily for me, I have a coach who has trust in me." The central midfielder has filled in the void in the absence of the likes of injured duo Roland Putsche and Thabo Nodada. Meanwhile, Cape Town City meet Polokwane City at Cape Town Stadium tonight (8pm). The home side are third on the log, while the visitors are placed sixth. With this in mind, Mokeke admitted that the Limpopo side will provide a difficult game. "We are confident, but we need to respect what Polokwane have done so far," Mokeke continued. "But everybody is fighting for three points and we can't say we fear them or what - we just respect them. "Whenever we are on the field we have to fight for the three points." In what could be an interesting battle, Mokeke will come up against the likes of evergreen midfielder Jabulani Maluleke, who's played a pivotal role in Polokwane's surprising performance so far this campaign.
