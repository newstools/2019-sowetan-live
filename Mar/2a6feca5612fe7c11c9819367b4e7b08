Beleaguered Baroka FC coach Wedson Nyirenda says he is irritated by the continuing celebration of the club’s Telkom Knockout win as he feels it is detracting from the seriousness of their battle against relegation. Baroka are flirting with danger as they sit just a single point above the drop zone despite winning their first major trophy in December‚ when they edged Orlando Pirates to the cup on post-match penalties. Nyirenda has already warned that the cup hangover could have a serious impact on their league performances and again this weekend expressed his concern that the party was going on too long. Baroka held another parade of the trophy at a ceremony in Bochum in Limpopo Province‚ where the club’s owner Khurishi Mphahlele was the lead participant. But Nyirenda says it is time to forget about the Telkom Knockout and end all the celebrations. “We need to focus on what is happening now and forget about the past‚” he warned after losing the derby 3-1 to Polokwane City on Sunday. He says he is scared about being dragged into the bottom two‚ but also provided a positive look at the situation. “It’s worrying but the beauty about the situation is that there are just a few points between five teams (at the bottom of the standings). “You win a few games in a row and your circumstance changes completely‚” Nyirenda added. “It is the same in the top four and also for the teams in the middle. It is now about not dropping points‚ you have to be consistent in this business.” Nyirenda bemoaned their defeat at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday saying his side had gifted their neighbours goals. They next take on Highlands Park away at Tembisa on Saturday.
