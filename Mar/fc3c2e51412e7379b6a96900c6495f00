Bidvest Wits takes on Chippa United in the anticipated Nedbank Cup quarter-final at the Bidvest Stadium on Saturday. The match, scheduled to kick-off at 8:15pm, will determine the fate of the two teams in the cup. Wits striker Gift Motupa will be looking to upset the team he joined and then later abandoned when they meet this weekend. Motupa was the centre of a dramatic transfer at the start of the season after Chippa signed him from Orlando Pirates but he was soon snatched by Wits. "I never trained with them [Chippa] so it was just on paper that I was part of the club and then Wits came to inquire about me," Motupa said. "When that happened I just took it as God's plan but I am happy in the end that I am here." Date: Saturday, March 30 Kick-off: 8:15pm Venue: Bidvest Stadium, Johannesburg
