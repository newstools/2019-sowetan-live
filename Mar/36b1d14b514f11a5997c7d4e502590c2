A woman has been arrested after staging a semi-nude protest at the Union Buildings in Pretoria today. The woman, who has been identified as Gugu Ncube, demanded to see president Ramaphosa as she protested against the ‘lack of action’ by her former employer Unisa, after she reported being allegedly sexually harassed by a professor. Ncube who was clad in only her panties and another panty around her breasts was arrested by the police for public indecency. According to Saps Spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela she was later released from the Sunny Side Police Station in Pretoria on a warning and is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court within the next 48 hours. In a video that has been making the rounds on social media she alleges that there has been a cover up of her ordeal by the management of the university. “To the United Nations I am a victim of sexual harassment. I tried getting the Unisa Vice Chancellor, he threw me out like a rotten pig…” she said. “They claim I have resigned. I never resigned; they chased me away from work because I refused to sleep with my manager.” The university has since denied these allegations. In the statement, Unisa claims that Ncube was an employee of an external company that was sponsored by the university. “Unisa’s main concern is that it is not for the first time that Ms Ncube continues to misconstrue this matter and attempt to drag its name into the dispute between herself and the Unisa Centre for Early Childhood Education (UCECE),” the statement reads. “As for the complaint of sexual harassment laid by Ms Ncube in 2018, the university followed due processes to deal with this matter, including the immediate suspension of the staff member of Unisa who were Board Members at UCECE.” However the university said after investigating the matter they found no basis to charge the staff members involved.
