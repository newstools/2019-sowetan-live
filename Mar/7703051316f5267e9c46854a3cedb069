Highlands Park may not win the Absa Premiership title this season but the newcomers left an indelible mark on the league this season. That is how coach Owen da Gama feels. The shrewd 57-year-old mentor has not given up the fight for the top-eight bracket as yet. The Tembisa, Ekurhuleni- based side, who are currently ninth on the log, will face sixth-placed Kaizer Chiefs at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban tomorrow (6pm). "Look, we play a fantastic team who do not have any away or home games. Wherever Chiefs play is home for them. It is an away game for us and we must continue with our good travelling record. We do not fear Chiefs but instead respect them," said Da Gama yesterday. "Results are what we needed most. We are happy with our performance and our position on the table. Our campaign has been with no big- name players yet they did so well. We will fight until the end of the season." Club top goalscorer Mothobi Mvala returned for the 0-0 draw with Black Leopards in Thohoyandou last weekend after missing three matches due to injury. Mvala believes Highlands can hold their own against Amakhosi after the sides drew 0-0 at Makhulong in the first round. "Gone are the days when some clubs' superiority just made them firm favourites to win games," Mvala warned. "We want points, so does Chiefs. It is going to be war but I think we need to score quick goals because their defence tends to make mistakes of late."
