SuperSport United's promising winger Khanyisile Mayo sees his loan switch to NFD side Maccabi as a perfect stepping stone to emulate his father Patrick. Khanyisile, 19, is the son of former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana striker-turned-defender Patrick Mayo. His elder brother, Khanyisa, is currently on the books of another second-tier side Royal Eagles. Khanyisile is due to return to SuperSport at the end of the season. "Joining Maccabi is a great opportunity to grow. I want to create the same legacy as my father ... this is like a start," Khanyisile told Sowetan yesterday. The Amajita international said the move to the NFD was facilitated by his agent Sean Roberts. The youngster nearly ended up at Ajax Cape Town. "My agent called two days before the transfer window deadline, telling me that it's time for me to go swim with the big fish now and get some exposure in the big league. I agreed because it was a step forward which I had to take. "He told me about Ajax first but later on ... like an hour before the transfer window closed, that I'll be moving to Maccabi." Before linking up with Maccabi, Mayo had netted 11 goals in the MDC. He has featured in all Maccabi's last three matches. Khanyisile is confident they'll survive relegation. They are 13th on the table. Meanwhile, the match between leaders Stellenbosch and bottom-placed Real Kings was abandoned due to inclement weather in Durban. NFD results: Ubuntu 1, Umoya 2; Mbombela 2, Tshakhuma 1; Cosmos 1, Eagles 1; Uthongathi 1, Richards Bay 0; Spurs 1, Galaxy 4; Maccabi 0, AmaTuks 1; Ajax 2, Sporting 0.
