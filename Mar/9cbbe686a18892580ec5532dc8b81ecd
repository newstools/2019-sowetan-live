Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan has assured South Africans that Eskom and government will address the load-shedding problems affecting the country. Speaking to reporters in Rosebank on Tuesday, Gordhan said the nation was faced with a crisis and there was no room to point fingers but just fix the problem. "The Eskom staff, the board and government are doing the best they can to address the problem," Gordhan said. "We understand the frustration. We don't have a magic formula. It is going to be a huge struggle to overcome load-shedding." Gordhan added that a team of engineers had been flying over Mozambique to do an assessment of the damage caused by the storm which destroyed distribution lines bringing power to South Africa. The tropical storm that has hit Mozambique since last week has led to the damage of the infrastructure which transfers electricity from the Cahora Bassa hydroelectrical power station in Mozambique's Tete province to South Africa. This, according to Eskom, has forced SA into stage four load-shedding over the past few days.
