Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela has given his take on the numbers game in this tight Absa Premiership race. The 2018/19 season has been a neck-and-neck race with only a few points separating the teams at the top. There is a similar scenario at the bottom end of the standings, where there are also a few points between the teams in the relegation terrain. Arrows are 11th , with 25 points after five wins, 10 draws and eight losses. Komphela's record since taking over in January is two wins, three draws and two losses. "Everybody who has not made the 30-point mark is still within the [relegation] mix," Komphela said. "Anybody who has not made 40 points is not qualified for a top eight [berth] and anybody who has not made 60 points has not won the championship. If you are not above 30 points, you have to work and those are the stats." Abafana Bes'thende have been camping in Polokwane for the past five days. They suffered a 2-0 loss against Polokwane City at the weekend and will now face Baroka at the Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm). A negative result for either team could see them sucked further into the relegation zone. Baroka are hovering dangerously above the danger zone in 13th place with 21 points from 23 games. In their last game against Highlands Park, the Limpopo outfit gave up a lead to lose 2-1. Their coach Wedson Nyirenda has bemoaned his players' poor concentration levels and has urged them to pull up their socks. "The boys must really do better because we keep on shooting ourselves in the foot," he said. "When we are in the relegation zone we can't be taking the lead and then end up losing the game. It's unacceptable."
