With Mamelodi Sundowns having overcome Cape Town City midweek, Pitso Mosimane hopes the very same team he conquered will now do him a favour against Bidvest Wits tomorrow. Sundowns and Wits have an ongoing to and fro battle for the summit of the table and it seems City will have a big say on who reigns supreme. After suffering a 3-2 loss to Downs in Pretoria, the Citizens will be looking to make up for that loss against Wits at Milpark (8.15pm). Sundowns on the other end will take on Bloemfontein Celtic at Loftus Versfeld (3.30pm). "City play Wits when we play Celtic so somebody must cancel each other. Somebody must drop points," Mosimane said. "I hope Celtic do not disturb us, but the big one is the return leg in Cape Town. They (City) won't allow us to score three goals again." City and Sundowns play each other twice in the space of a week in the league after their fixture last year was postponed due to Sundowns' CAF Champions League obligations. The champions find themselves on top of the table for the first time this season with 10 games to go before the end. As they make a push for their ninth league title, Mosimane aims to hold onto the number one spot until the end. "All this time we have been too generous. If we apply our experience of being there [on top] and normally when we are there we don't come back," he said. "Ever since I have been here in the last five years we have been either first or second. Wits have been strong but you cannot be on the top for so long."
