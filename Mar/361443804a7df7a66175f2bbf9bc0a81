Two thugs who stole a brand new satellite TV decoder from shocked youngsters met their match when they were chased and arrested by three female law enforcement officers in Cape Town. "The victims approached three female law enforcement officers on patrol in the area and told the officers they were robbed of a bag containing‚ among other things‚ a brand new satellite television decoder they had patiently saved money for‚ to buy for the family‚" said the city's law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason on Thursday. "The officers loaded the victims into their vehicle and set about to find the suspects‚" after the robbery at the weekend in Mitchells Plain. After spotting the fleeing suspects‚ the officers gave chase and arrested them. The stolen goods were recovered. "The victims‚ who are quite young‚ declined to press charges and the officers transported the shocked youngsters to Delft where they were reunited with a very grateful mom‚" said Dyason.
