As the leader of the Bidvest Wits attack, Deon Hotto admits that he has been disappointed with some of his performances of late. Wits have been hit by a slump in form that has seen them elbowed from the top of the Absa Premiership to fourth position. The university outfit is winless in the last four games after three losses and a draw. During this poor streak they suffered back-to-back losses to Cape Town City (3-2) and AmaZulu (2-0). Particularly poor was their loss to City where they relinquished a 2-0 lead to end up losing at home. "Yeah, we have been letting ourselves down in the past few games and we really need to do better," Hotto said. "I also get a bit hard on myself because the team and the coach expect much better from me. As a team, we just need to pick ourselves up and perform." The title-chasers will be looking to bounce back from the slump in their clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at Seisa Ramabodu Stadium tonight (8pm). Hotto, 28, will be facing the team he left in the off-season to join the Clever Boys. "It won't be easy going up against them because they are so compact and play with a structure," he said. "I had some great moments with them but I am a Wits player now and I am a professional." Gavin Hunt is so dependent on Hotto as a key puzzle piece that he would rather play him out of position rather than to have him out of the team.
