A memorial service for slain actor Sibusiso Khwinana started off with song and praise at AFM Hilltop Restoration Centre in Soshanguve Block K, north of Pretoria, on Thursday. Khwinana, a lead actor in hit movie 'Matwetwe', was stabbed to death during an alleged armed robbery for his cellphone in Pretoria last week. Gauteng MEC for community safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane told mourners that police will not rest until Khwinana's killers are captured. "To those who killed our hero, you have not only hurt the Khwinana family but you've hurt all South African citizens; and for that we will run after you until we find you because of the pain we are feeling. We will not rest until the perpetrators are arrested. Pasop tsotsi, siyeza kuwe, " she said. Speaker-after-speaker described Khwinana as a humble and passionate person, as dozens of Khwinana's family and friends packed the Hilltop hall.
