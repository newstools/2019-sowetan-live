Three vehicle examiners and a cashier at a vehicle testing station were on Tuesday arrested for allegedly issuing fraudulent roadworthy certificates for vehicles that had never been physically tested in Musina, Limpopo. "The arrests followed months of investigation by members of the Hawks, the road traffic management corporation's anti-corruption unit and the Special Investigating Unit," said Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) in a statement. RTMC's spokesperson Simon Zwane said the group were arrested at Thusalushaka testing station and are facing charges of fraud and corruption. "It is alleged that the officials colluded in using the identity particulars of a 60-year-old man to generate roadworthy certificates for scores of vehicles that were never brought to the testing station for examination. "Investigations however showed that the man was not even aware that his particulars were being used in this manner," said Zwane. Following the arrest, documents and computers were seized at the testing station. The four suspects are expected to appear in the Musina magistrate's court on Wednesday. Zwane said it was not the first time that officials were busted for a similar crime. "A similar raid was conducted at the same testing station in December last year where two officials were arrested. They were released on bail and are expected to make another court appearance on the 29th of April," he said. Vehicle roadworthiness is one of the main contributing factors leading to road crashes and fatalities in the country, hence the raid was conducted to help reduce this threat in the coming Easter period, added Zwane.
