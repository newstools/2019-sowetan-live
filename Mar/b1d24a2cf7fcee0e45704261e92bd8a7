"Nice guys finish last in the CAF Champions League." With these words Mamelodi Sundowns goalie Kennedy Mweene highlighted the current mentality of the club as they look for progress to the knockout stages. The 2016 holders of the CAF competition will be looking to secure their spot to the next phase with a win over Lobi Stars at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow (9pm). "In the Champions League there is no time for pretty football, but what it needs is affective football," Mweene told Sowetan. "Whether by hook or crook we must win this game. We don't want to go to Morocco having to win there. We want to go there with our souls relaxed." The trip to Morocco will be Downs' final match of Group A against another former champions Wydad Casablanca. The Brazilians want to secure qualification at the weekend and avoid having to travel to Morocco with a must-win mission. A win will be enough as it will take Downs to 10 points but it won't be easy against Lobi whom they lost 2-1 to in the first-leg earlier this year. "In Champions League it's different. Nothing is a given in this tournament, so we will not be focusing on that loss against them," he said. The evergreen Zambian has been his old dependable self for Downs, with Denis Onyango sidelined with a hip injury. The 34-year-old will again be relied upon to hold the last line of defensive for the Tshwane club. "I don't have anything to prove to the coaches because they know what I can do. That's why whenever I play I am not under pressure. "So far, so good, when I have been standing in for the injured Denis. I am just here to help the team and contribute to our objectives." At home Sundowns should have the upper hand having won their two home games in the group (the 2-1 win over Wydad and the 3-1 thrashing on Asec Mimosas). Lobi on the other hand have no win on the road after their 1-0 loss to Asec and goalless draw with Wydad.
