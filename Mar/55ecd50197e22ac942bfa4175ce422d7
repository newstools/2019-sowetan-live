Bloemfontein Celtic defender Tshepo Rikhotso has faith in his new central defensive partnership with Mzwanele Mahashe. Mahashe made his third league appearance in their 0-0 draw against Sundowns, coming off the bench to partner Rikhotso in the heart of defence after first- choice centre-back Wandisile Letlabika suffered concussion. After putting in a man-of- the-match performance and scoring in their 1-1 draw against Pirates on Tuesday, Rikhotso sounded very pleased about his new partner. "Mahashe is very strong. he's experienced. You saw how he conducted himself when he came on for Letlabika against Sundowns. "I enjoy playing with him. We have a nice understanding," said Rikhotso of Letlabika. "Even at Baroka Mahashe was a reliable defender. I am not surprised that he has managed to step up to the plate when Letlabika got injured. This shows that we have a strong team.'' Meanwhile, Celtic interim coach Lehlohonolo Seema provided an update on Letlabika's injury, reiterating that the defender is an integral part of the set-up of the Free State club. "I spoke to him [Letlabika] on Saturday and on Sunday we spoke again. Wandi is recovering well. He went back to Bloemfontein and he will be out for two weeks. We will see him when we get home. have coffee with him," noted Seema. "We need him. He is a very important member of our team. one of our captains. "Definitely, when he recovers he will come back and give us that stability at the back."
