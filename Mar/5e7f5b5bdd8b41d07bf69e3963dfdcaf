The fact that Kaizer Chiefs are facing their fourth straight season without a trophy is not a concern for coach Ernst Middendorp. Middendorp is focused on the here and now. Chiefs' most realistic chance for some silverware this season is the Nedbank Cup and the German has faith that his team can go all the way. They face Cape Town City in the quarterfinals at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday (3pm). "Are you really expecting that this past history - what happened - that it is part of preparing my team? "It's a game in Nelspruit against Cape Town City. why should I be busy with providing numbers from years back, so this question is not relevant for me," Middendorp hit back. To be fair, it's a reality for Chiefs that if they fall short against Benni McCarthy's charges, it could leave them without a trophy for four full seasons since they are seven points behind log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns with six matches remaining in the league. Middendorp continued: "We will prepare ourselves, going with the right mentality and show the right attitude. I think that will be crucial with the players we have and we have enough potential. We have a quarterfinal and we can go to the semifinals." He admitted that there's pressure to finally come good and get the Amakhosi faithful smiling again. "Listen, if a coach is saying, 'ah, there's no pressure', believe me that's absolutely nonsense. If you don't have pressure... go home and sell insurance or do something else." The 40,000-seat venue could be sold out with fans snapping up the tickets at a fast rate and a lot of eyes would be on goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma, who's expected to start again since Daniel Akpeyi is cup tied. "Well, it won't be an easy game as you've seen that [City] have been playing well in the league," Bvuma said.
