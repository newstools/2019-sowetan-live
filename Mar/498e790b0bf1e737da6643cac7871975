The meteoric rise of the likes of Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya and now Happy Mashiane at the right-back position paints a grim picture of Letlhogonolo Mirwa's future at Kaizer Chiefs. Having joined Chiefs alongside the likes of Khama Billiat and Andriamirado "Dax" Andrianarimanana in June last year from ABC Motsepe League side Buya Msuthu, Mirwa has found it difficult to break into the first team at Naturena as he's is yet to register his first team debut. Nevertheless, the lad from Rustenburg in the North West, believes he still has a chance to don the famous gold and black jersey in an official top-flight match. Mirwa hardly missed action for Amakhosi's MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) this season. "Coming to the team was a learning curve itself. It was for me to grow, and understand the culture. "You just have to grow and you cannot complain. When an opportunity comes, I should be able to grab it with both hands. I am still part of the team and very optimistic going forward," said Mirwa. Ironically, the 23-year-old defender draws inspiration from how Mashiane was given an opportunity after impressing in the MDC side. Mirwa implied he has had a positive conversation with head coach Ernst Middendorp. "Playing in the MDC is helping me a lot... to keep fit and stay focused. "Coach Ernst is a good coach, and so far, everything that he's said to me are positives," Mirwa noted. "I'm looking forward to working with him. You look at what happened to Mashiane, so why can't it happen to me? I just have to push myself." Mirwa came through the development ranks at Mamelodi Sundowns, but failed to win a first team contract. "That's the nature of football... nothing is guaranteed. "I have moved on from what happened at Downs," Mirwa asserted.
