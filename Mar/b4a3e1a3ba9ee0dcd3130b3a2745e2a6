The state has withdrawn a charge of murder against one of three suspects accused of killing Thorisho Themane. Prosecutor Disebo Kgoelenya told a packed Polokwane magistrate's court on Monday that he is withdrawing the charge against the suspect who was arrested last week. Kgoelenya did not give reasons for the withdrawal but indicated that the other two suspects will continue to apply for bail on Monday morning.
