SA's U-23 side boasts a great group of players on paper, but putting together a starting XI that can bring home the results has its own challenges. Based at the SA Football Association's technical centre, Funny Valley, between Eldorado Park and Lenasia in the south of Johannesburg, the squad has been hard at work preparing for the upcoming 2019 CAF U-23 Cup of Nations qualifier against Angola in Luanda on Friday. Head coach David Notoane was all smiles when overseas-based players Luther Singh and Lyle Foster arrived yesterday while he was busy chatting to the media. It was a relief for Notoane seeing the overseas-based boys make it to camp. Striker Liam Jordan couldn't make it after his Danish club Koge FC received his call- up letter late and asked that he stay put. Crystal Palace's Nikola Tavares also couldn't travel because his passport has expired and it may take time before he secures a new one. Notoane, however, still has a squad brimming with talent, but now has to decide on a winning team. "Day one, on Sunday, we had 21 players and it was heart-warming. Of the foreign players, a lot of them were involved with their teams on Saturday and Sunday, so it created a travel logistical nightmare," Notoane told the media. Despite some late arrivals, the former Santos striker expects the overseas-based players to quickly adjust. "They have the talent and the ability. If they are indeed at the high level in Europe, as we perceive, I expect them to fit in and understand the tactical game plan that we are trying to put in place," he said.
