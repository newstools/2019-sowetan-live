The SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) in KwaZulu-Natal has praised gqom star Babes Wodumo for her bravery in taking a stand to expose her suffering‚ allegedly at the hands of her boyfriend Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo. Addressing journalists in Durban on Tuesday‚ Sadtu provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said the shocking video footage showing Wodumo‚ whose real name is Bongekile Simelane‚ being assaulted was a "true reflection" of the violent abuse suffered by many women in society. "Even though there are good men‚ there are still pockets of those who see themselves as bigger in every aspect than women. Those are the men who do not value women‚" said Caluza. She said such men viewed women "as their objects‚ to be kicked around and beaten". "What we see in the video is just one of the many incidents that remain unreported. That is why Sadtu applauds Babes Wodumo for her bravery in taking a stand to expose the suffering she is subjected to in the name of love." Caluza said violence against women could cause long-term physical and mental problems and did not just affect the women involved but also their children‚ families and communities. "As teachers we have witnessed some behaviour by learners which is an indication of a child raised in a violent environment‚" she said. "Sadtu must join hands with other organisations in campaigning against the scourge of domestic violence and gender-based violence." - TMG Digital
