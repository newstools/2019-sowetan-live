AFP reported that Idai demolished more than 5,700 homes and affected more than  140,000 people. About 111 people were reported missing and 168,000ha of land was destroyed. Malawi UN News on Friday reported that the death toll in Malawi stood at 56, with the country's Chikwawa district being one of the worst affected.
