Police have made yet another massive drug bust in Durban, this time in the quiet suburb of Westville. During an intelligence-driven operation, members of the provincial organised crime unit, K9 currency unit and crime intelligence pounced on two suspects at Chiltern Heights  on Thursday, said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. "On arrival, policed found the suspects packaging drugs for distribution. Police seized pure uncut cocaine, rock cocaine and ecstasy tablets with an estimated value of more than R250,000. The suspects, aged 33 and 35,  will appear in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Friday. In separate operations held in Margate, south of Durban, and the Point area, in Durban's Central Business District, more drugs  were seized. "Cocaine powder and methcathanone were found on vacant premises in Margate. Slopes of heroin were recovered in Point and the premises were already vacated on police arrival. The recovered drugs have a combined street value of more than R16,000," said Gwala. Earlier this month, seven people were arrested following a R50m drugs laboratory bust in Springfield Industrial Park, just outside the Durban CBD.
