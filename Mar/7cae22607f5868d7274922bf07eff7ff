Former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi has calculated that the company received about R2.5bn in revenue annually via various contracts stemming from provincial governments, state departments and the private sector between 2000 and 2016. He says the company forked out about R75m a year on bribes or "gratuities" to secure these contracts. Testifying before the Zondo inquiry into state capture on Thursday, Agrizzi recollected that there were about 38 government officials and politicians on Bosasa's payroll. According to Agrizzi, the bulk of Bosasa's revenue came from the Department of Correctional Services (about R580m a year), the Department of Justice (about R700m annually), security for correctional services facilities (about R241m a year) and TV systems for correctional services facilities (about R300m annually). Bosasa is alleged to have paid about R40m in bribes each year for these contracts alone. His testimony so far has filled gaps in his evidence provided to the commission when he first appeared earlier in 2019. Agrizzi's testimony is continuing.
