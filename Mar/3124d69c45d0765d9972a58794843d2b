The Gauteng education department has condemned yet another assault on a pupil - this time at a school in Edenvale, east of Johannesburg. The incident - caught on video footage on Friday - shows a fight between two pupils at Edenvale High School. Thirty-six seconds into the video, a grade 9 pupil who was allegedly assaulted can be heard saying to the alleged perpetrator: "If you want me, come to me." The two pupils are then seen fighting while others watch and cheer. "The perpetrator was precautionarily suspended with immediate effect, pending the disciplinary hearing in due course," the department said in a statement. Parents of both pupils were notified of the disciplinary processes. "Psycho-social support has already been provided to the victim, who unfortunately sustained minor jaw injuries. This support will also be extended to the perpetrator," the department said. Meanwhile, Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited Crystal Park High School where pupils were filmed beating a classmate. In the video, taken on Wednesday last week, a defenceless girl is seen on the ground, surrounded by other female pupils who kicked and slapped her. While she was being assaulted, other pupils laughed and encouraged her attackers. Lesufi said he was not opposed to criminal charges being laid against the perpetrators.
