Nkosinathi Onyedikachi Ononogbu of National First Division side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila is gutted at missing out on selection for the SA U23 squad that will play in the 2020 Olympic qualifiers. Born of Nigerian father, it's possible that his surname may have counted against him - maybe selectors thought he's not eligible to represent SA. However, Ononogbu is eligible to play for the country of his birth. He has a South African mother and was born and raised in Ivory Park, Midrand. "I thought I deserve a chance, but I guess it's not my time," said Ononogbu, who has six goals in the NFD this season. "I will support the gents, then continue to work hard for my spot," said the 21-year-old. "Maybe there's a confusion because of my surname, but I am South African. I want to represent the country of my birth," he insisted. The winger has put behind his disappointment and is now focused on helping his Limpopo side against the NFD leaders, Stellenbosch, in Thohoyandou tomorrow (3.30pm). Tshakhuma will be playing for a place in the PSL promotion/play-offs, while Stellenbosch are looking to stay clear of second-placed Ajax Cape Town in hunting for automatic promotion.
