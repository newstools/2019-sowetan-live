SA's u23 team will do well not to underestimate Angola when the two nations meet at Bidvest Stadium in a CAF U-23 Cup of Nations qualifier tonight (7pm). There's no doubt that this is expected to be a walkover for the hosts after winning 3-1 in the first leg that was played in Luanda last week. Despite SA having the likes of Phakamani Mahlambi, Luther Singh and Lyle Foster, Angola have nothing to lose and will give it a go. The challenge for SA would be to guard against complacency in thinking the job is done when there's entire 90 minutes to play in this tie. What killed Angola in their own backyard was conceding early with Mahlambi on the scoresheet after just seven minutes. In search of two goals while keeping a clean sheet to turn it all around to progress, Angola are likely to play an open game from the first whistle. This is where David Notoane's boys can hurt them by getting an early goal, which would surely end it as a contest. Notoane has expressed confidence that his team will get another win and progress into the second round, which is the final hurdle in qualifying for the tournament that will be hosted by Egypt in November. It's all to play for from both ends, which could turn this into a great match to watch. The winner of this tie will face Zimbabwe or Eswatini/Mozambique.
