If you want financial security, then having a strict budget is important. A good budget helps you prioritise your spending and stay on top of your monthly expenses and loan repayments. Setting up a budget gives you a clear idea of what’s coming in and going out of your account. More importantly, knowing your interest rate on all your loans can help you decide which loans to pay off quicker to have more control of your cash flow. Make extra payments on your instalments into your loan with the highest interest rate, to reduce total debt obligations. For example, a loan of R10,000 over 24 months, at an interest rate of 20.5%, with a repayment amount of R642.16 will incur total interest of R2,548.34. By increasing your instalment by R100, the term reduces to 20 months and interest to R2,045.67 Top personal lending tips for budgeting:  This article was paid for by Standard Bank.
