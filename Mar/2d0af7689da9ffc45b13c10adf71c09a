Thabiso Semenya and Jabu Maluleke are among the oldest players in the Absa Premiership and on Sunday, in the Polokwane derby, both will look to use their wisdom to guide their teams to victory. Semenya's Baroka will take on the Maluleke-led Polokwane City in a clash that will bring the city to a standstill at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Baroka have been blowing hot and cold in the league since winning the Telkom Knockout title in December. Bakgaga are 12th in the standings with 21 points which is a worrying position to be in as they are only two points above the relegation zone. Rise and Shine on the other hand are eighth with 29 points. Semenya, 36, does not want to lose to their city rivals twice after their 2-0 loss in the first round back in August. "In games like these you need to be cautious because they have been doing well and are eighth on the table," the veteran defender said. "The advantage is with them and we want to move away from the relegation zone. We got our first win this year last week [2-1 win over SuperSport United], so we need to take it a game at a time. "There are many emotions in the derby that include pressure from the chairman and not wanting to lose to a neighbour." Maluleke, also aged 36, expects Baroka to come out strong as they have their backs against the wall. "The derby is a tricky game and you will remember that we beat them in the first game of the season," he said. "This one will be a challenge, it is different from that game. It's tough being in the relegation zone, I have been there, so we just have to contain them as they will come out guns blazing."
