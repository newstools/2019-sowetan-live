Mamelodi Sundowns will need to put up a disciplined defensive effort against the highest scoring team in the Absa Premiership Cape Town City. The Citizens will face the league-leading Sundowns at the Cape Town Stadium tonight (7.30pm) in a rematch after their clash last week. With 37 goals from 22 games, the Mother City club have the best goals' record in the Absa Premiership. Sundowns have only scored 27. Downs emerged 3-2 victors in that thrilling match at Loftus Versfeld as they kept out the Citizens who looked to set a late surge. Downs defender Mosa Lebusa admits that his team will need to remain defensively solid against City. "I have played with many players in the City team from the junior ranks and they are dangerous attackers who need to be watched closely and be given limited space," Lebusa said. "Defensively, there will be little room to make a mistake because the game tends to be so open. I know that there will be scoring chances but our job is to limit those chances and frustrate their attack." It will be a different game to the goalless draw Sundowns played against the defensively compact Bloemfontein Celtic at the weekend. There is little margin for error at the top of the standings, where the Tshwane giants hold a narrow lead with 40 points. Orlando Pirates trail close behind with 39 points while Bidvest Wits have 38 and on fourth, City are on 36. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane conceded that it was anyone's race to win at this stage. "I don't know, anybody can take it, hey. I have said before that there is a long way to go and it's all about who wants it," he said.
