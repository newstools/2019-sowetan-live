A finance clerk at Clicks allegedly defrauded the retail giant of more than R4m. Themba Maneli, 24, appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court after being arrested last week with his girlfriend, Nanky Kanase, 24, Hawks spokesman Captain Philani Nkwalase said on Wednesday. On Monday, the asset forfeiture unit and the Hawks’ serious commercial crimes investigation unit secured a R2.4m preservation order against the couple, who are charged with fraud, theft and money laundering. Nkwalase said they remained in police custody and were due to apply for bail on Wednesday. “Maneli, a finance clerk in Clicks’ IT finance department, allegedly colluded with his girlfriend and submitted fictitious invoices over a period of time for payment exceeding R4m to a company owned and directed by his girlfriend,” he said. “Over R1.6m was already transferred to different bank accounts and the stolen funds were quickly depleted through electronic payments and ATM withdrawals. “The Hawks’ swift investigation landed the two in jail, whilst the asset forfeiture unit managed to freeze the remaining alleged stolen millions of rand.”
