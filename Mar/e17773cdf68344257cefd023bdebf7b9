While many seem to favour Darren Keet as the man to start for Bafana Bafana against Libya, Ronwen Williams' experience in CAF competition could give him the edge. Bafana coach Stuart Baxter faces a selection dilemma with first-choice Itumeleng Khune sidelined by injury. Baxter has admitted that the battle for the number one jersey will be between Keet and Williams while Bruce Bvuma is also in the squad. SA will take on the North Africans in the final Group E clash of the Afcon qualifiers at the Stade Taieb Mhiri in Sfax, Tunisia, on Sunday (7pm). While Keet, 29, is older and more experienced, SuperSport United's run in the CAF Confederation Cup last year could boost Williams' chances. The 27-year-old Williams was integral to Matsatsantsa's campaign, where they reached the CAF final only to lose to TP Mazembe. While Keet won the Absa Premiership with Bidvest Wits two seasons ago, he does not have much experience on the continent. Keet has nine caps for Bafana while Williams has six. Bafana goalkeeper coach Andre Arendse says the technical team will decide tomorrow on the starting goalkeeper. "When you look at the clean sheets that Darren and Ronwen have had for their clubs, it's very similar," Arendse said. "It's evenly contested and cannot give you a name right now. It will possibly go down to the last training session." Arendse also touched on the thinking process informing who would start. "Selecting the starting keeper is not going to be done right away. We need to give them this week's training, [factor in] the opposition's strengths and how they set-up, that affects not only the goalkeepers but the [entire] starting XI."
