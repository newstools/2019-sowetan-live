Orlando Pirates can make it a double over KwaZulu-Natal sides when they take on Golden Arrows at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm). Bucs are fresh from thumping AmaZulu 4-1 at Orlando Stadium last Saturday and now lock horns with Abafana Bes'thende in Clermont, Durban. It's a must-win for Micho Sredojevic's men who are in the race for league honours. In Arrows, however, Pirates will encounter a side that has lost just once in eight matches across all competitions since Steve Komphela took over from Clinton Larsen in December. With Komphela at the helm, Arrows have four wins, three draws and one defeat. Komphela would also be relishing being in the dugout against Pirates from his Soweto Derby experiences after coaching Chiefs from 2015 to last year. His task will be to stop Pirates' dominance over Arrows in recent years. In their last 10 league meetings, Pirates have beaten Arrows six times, losing two and drawing two. With the league to play for, Pirates are expected to go on an all-out attack the same way they did against AmaZulu last weekend. But they will have to keep an eye on forwards Lerato Lamola and Knox Mutizwa, who have been getting the goals for the hosts lately.
