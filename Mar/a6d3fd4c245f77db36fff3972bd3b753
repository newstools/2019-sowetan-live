"We hereby confirm that our scheduled flight ET 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi was involved in accident today," the airline said in a statement. "It is believed that there were 149 passengers and eight crew on board the flight but we are currently confirming the details of the passenger manifest for the flight." The airline said "search and rescue operations are in progress and we have no confirmed information about survivors or any possible casualties." The plane took off at 8:38 am (0638 GMT) from Bole International Airport and "lost contact" six minutes later.
