A 51-year-old father has died in hospital after being stabbed while trying to overpower housebreakers with his son on a farm at Kirkwood in the Eastern Cape. Three suspects involved in the attack on Sunday evening at the farm in Dunbrody are being sought by the police. “The family was at home when an unknown male entered the house. The 51-year-old father and his son allegedly managed to overpower the suspect,” said police spokesperson captain Gerda Swart. “Suddenly two more suspects entered the house, of which one started stabbing the 51-year-old father in his back. The father and son released the suspect and the threesome ran away from the scene.” The father was taken to a local hospital for treatment but succumbed to his injuries. “A task team consisting of various specialised units was set up immediately in order to search for the three suspects. It is alleged that the suspects wore balaclavas at the time of the attack. It is not clear at this stage if anything was taken during the robbery,” said Swart. A case of murder and house robbery is under investigation.
