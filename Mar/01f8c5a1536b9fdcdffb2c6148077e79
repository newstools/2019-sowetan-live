A driver and a school principal are to be charged with overloading a minibus taxi after 65 pupils were found crammed into the vehicle. The video showing 48 school pupils alighting from a taxi that was stopped by traffic officers in Port Elizabeth in February was bad enough. But on Thursday, a Gauteng taxi driver took cramming in passengers to the next level when 65 pupils were found squashed together inside his vehicle. The vehicle was certified to carry 26 passengers, meaning it was transporting more than twice the maximum number of passengers permitted. The taxi was stopped at a road block forming part of operation #OkaeMolao, aimed at cleaning up the roads in the province. To the driver's surprise, however, there were not only traffic officers at the roadblock. Gauteng premier David Makhura had also joined the inspection. Taking to the province's official Twitter page, Makhura's office said the minibus taxi belonged to the school where the pupils were registered. Traffic officers escorted the taxi to the school. Makhura's office said the driver and the school's principal would be charged with overloading.
