The situation remains tense at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's (UKZN's) Howard College campus after students went on a rampage on Friday morning and burnt down the guardhouse. A large contingent of members of the police public order unit and Mi7 security personnel were deployed on campus and no  vehicles were allowed on campus  after the protests. The students are protesting against university management's alleged failure to address some of their demands. When our sister publication TimesLIVE arrived on campus the situation was calm and students were sitting in groups while the police, who arrived in Nyalas, and a number of  armed Mi7 security guards patrolled the campus. The academic programme was suspended with immediate effect on Thursday following protests during which cars were stoned. SRC president Sanele Hlongwa said the student protests, which had extended to several of the institution's campuses namely Pietermaritzburg, Edgewood and Westville, would continue until management had addressed their demands. The protests are over issues relating to National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funding for post-graduate students, security issues for those living off-campus and admission challenges. "We engaged with management and we are agreed on some things but they have not been implemented. The protest will continue up until our grievances are met," he said.
