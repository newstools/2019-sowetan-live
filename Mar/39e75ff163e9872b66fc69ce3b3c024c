Rotational power cuts to municipalities have been suspended for this week, but electricity supply remains tight, says Eskom. "No load-shedding is anticipated for the coming week due to the electricity system gradually improving," said the energy utility on Sunday night. An improvement in plant performance, together with replenished diesel and water reserves over the last few days, as well as the increase of imports from Mozambique’s Cahora Bassa to 850MW, have positively shifted system performance, said Eskom. "The risk of load-shedding remains, as the system continues to be vulnerable. Load-shedding will only be implemented when absolutely necessary." In a separate statement, it said: "We continue to appeal to customers to continue to use electricity sparingly by switching off geysers and non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand." Eskom said the improved performance came with the return of five units since Friday morning, and an additional four units that were expected to return to service on Sunday. "In addition, we have achieved healthy diesel and water reserves." Imports from Mozambique’s Cahora Bassa have increased with the restoration of feed from one of the two lines. But, said Eskom, "the recent cyclone (Idai) has caused significant damage to the second transmission line, which will take several months to restore."
