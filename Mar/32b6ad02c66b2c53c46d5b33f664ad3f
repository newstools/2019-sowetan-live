Liam Jordan grabbed a brace of goals and helped set up another for his Danish side Koge as they resumed their league season after the winter break with a 3-3 draw against Federicia on Sunday. Jordan‚ who debuted for Bidvest Wits at the age of 16‚ was part of the development at Portuguese giants Sporting Lisbon and is a full Bafana Bafana international‚ has been something of a ‘forgotten man’ in South African football over the last 18 months. But he has started 2019 with a bang‚ his opening goal a historic one as the first to be scored at Koge’s brand new Capelli Sports Stadium that was officially opened before the match. Jordan turned home a loose ball in the box for his first and then it was his corner that ended with Jakob Johansson scoring a second. The South African’s second was a piece of artistry as he collected the ball on the right-hand side and chipped the goalkeeper to score at the far post. Koge could not hold on though as they conceded in the seventh-minute of injury-time to settle for a draw. Jordan will hope for a strong second half of the season as he looks to catch the eye of bigger clubs in Europe and finally fulfill the promise that he has shown since bursting onto the scene as a teenager. The 20-year-old played for Amajita at the last FIFA Under-20 World Cup in South Korea and also for Bafana Bafana at the 2017 Cosafa Cup.
