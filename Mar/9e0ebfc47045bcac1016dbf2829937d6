It took Mxolisi Macuphu 12 league games to score two goals for Bidvest Wits. But he's now on four goals in just five games for SuperSport United where he's on loan. Macuphu, 29, has emerged as one of the hottest strikers since joining Matsatsantsa in the January transfer window. SuperSport have won four games and lost one with Macuphu in the side, and suddenly they are one of the title contenders. In fifth spot, they are five points behind neighbours Mamelodi Sundowns with seven matches remaining. "As a striker... you get judged with the number of goals you score," Macuphu said during an interview with Sowetan at the club's training base yesterday. "When you play and you don't even get a single goal, you don't get recognised. It's a great start and it's a great environment." Macuphu and his teammates are preparing to face Kaizer Chiefs at Mbombela Stadium tomorrow (8pm). A win over Amakhosi will ensure the nation sits up and takes notice of the Tshwane side that until recently were aiming for a top-six finish. Macuphu, meanwhile, admitted he had expected to see his name in the Bafana Bafana team that will play Libya on March 24 in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Bafana need only a draw to qualify and Macuphu, who replaced the injured Lebo Mothiba in the first leg against Libya last year but didn't play, said he understood why coach Stuart Baxter snubbed him. "I did expect to see my name in the squad because once you've been there, you want to be there all the time. "But I respect the coach's decision and I also felt that if I was in his shoes, I would also want to go with the tried and tested," Macuphu added. Meanwhile, SuperSport midfielder Teboho Mokoena has been presented with the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award for January. Mokoena got the nod for his strike in the 2-1 win over Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium last month.
