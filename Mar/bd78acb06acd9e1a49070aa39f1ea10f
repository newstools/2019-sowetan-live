Emergency services on Friday rushed to the scene of another incident in Durban where a baby was discarded down a drain. Details were scant on Friday afternoon, but Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said the baby, believed to have been abandoned, was thrown down "some sort of drain" at around 1pm. Emergency workers were dispatched to the scene in Mountbatten Drive, Reservoir Hills. It was unclear at about 1.15pm whether the baby was still alive. This is a developing story.
