Although Gavin Hunt has conceded that his team have lost their advantage in the Absa Premiership, the Bidvest Wits coach feels they can still win the double. The university club were top of the league from the beginning of the year until recently and are now second with 41 points, two behind Mamelodi Sundowns. They also find themselves in the quarterfinals of the Nedbank Cup where they face Chippa United at the Bidvest Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm). "If we want to win the double we are going to have to play like hell because we were in such a good position and let it go, but what's gone is gone," Hunt said. "Now we have got the cup so let's see. I definitely want to have a go at it and see how far we can go. Over the years we have done well in cup competitions so we'll see." The 54-year-old coach has an impressive cup record since his appointment in 2013 as Wits coach, having delivered the MTN8 in 2016 and the Telkom Knockout in 2017. The closest Wits came to winning the Nedbank Cup was in 2014, when they lost 3-1 to Orlando Pirates in the final. Wits have been without the core of their squad - Darren Keet, Sfiso Hlanti, Thulani Hlatshwayo, Buhle Mkhwanazi, Elias Pelembe, Deon Hotto and Terrence Dzvukamanja - who were on international duty. "They are back but we have a few niggles here and there." Hunt wants his players to show more confidence at home. "We have had four games at home this season where we were leading and ended up losing," he observed.
