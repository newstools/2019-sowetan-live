Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) closed all of its campuses on Wednesday until further notice amid ongoing protests. "Academic programmes for students at all the TUT campuses have been closed with immediate effect, until further notice," said university spokesperson Willa de Ruyter. "The decision follows ongoing and often violent student protest action at TUT campuses since Monday March 4. Since there will not be any services available at on-campus residences and because management is concerned about the welfare of our students, they are therefore required to vacate residences for their own safety." De Ruyter said the university's priority was to protect students, staff and property. "Due to the volatility and unpredictability of the current situation, the university had no choice but to close academic activities for students, until further notice, in order to allow the situation to calm down." TUT said in a statement on Tuesday that students were protesting over National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) meal allowances. "This is a national policy matter and not within TUT’s authority," said De Ruyter on Tuesday.
