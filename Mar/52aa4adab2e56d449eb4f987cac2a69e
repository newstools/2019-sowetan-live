If ever there was any uncertainty about the title contention of Cape Town City, in the past week the Citizens surely removed all doubt. The Mother City outfit has a serious chance of capturing the Absa Premiership after a solid run that has them within a point of the summit. They have just completed a helluva week where they beat Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns in the space of four days. With the traditional big guns faltering along this season with inconsistencies, the remaining seven games may be their best chance to snatch the championship. It's a real chance to take the title to Cape Town for the first time in 17 years since Santos won it in 2002. City have 39 points from 23 games and are the highest-scoring team with 39 goals. Club director Michel Comitis admitted that the team was starting to dream about lifting the trophy. "It would be a fairytale to be honest and I think we have showed that we have a little bit more attitude than what's usual," Comitis said. "We have a team that is in the best form and mathematically we have been the best team in the country. We have an incredible togetherness and wonderful feeling within the team." Coach Benni McCarthy has opted to keep his composure and not jump the gun. "They say a man's character is tested when you play the best. For us it's one game at a time. If you guys [the media] take pictures of the log, we don't do that. We don't want to put ourselves under unnecessary pressure."
