Highlands Park captain Tapuwa Kapini says they are bracing themselves for a combustible competition from the troubled Baroka tomorrow. Highlands will host Bakgaga at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa, and are targeting three points to improve on their ninth spot standing on the Absa Premiership table. On the other hand, Baroka are desperate to grab maximum points to escape the danger zone. Kapini says it could be one of their hardest games this season, but hopes that, if home record is anything to go by, they should be home and dry. He, however, warned that that alone would not be enough. "Everyone must be on the same page, from directors to the fans and players. We must give our all. I am talking about the kind of performance we displayed when we played Bidvest Wits where we beat them 2-1 [last month]," he said. "You could see that players were willing to die on the pitch that day. We've got to go in there and fight because Baroka are also coming to fight. "Baroka are a good side and if we are to read too much into their current results, we will live to regret that. We must look at their current position as a warning to us as to what this game means to them." Baroka coach Wedson Nyirenda warned that they will throw everything they have into play and, fortunately, all his players fully understand the importance of this game. "We've been working on something at training and we will throw everything into it. It's not going to be an easy game, especially playing away, but we are ready," the Zambian said.
