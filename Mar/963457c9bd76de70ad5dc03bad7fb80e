Five pupils from Crystal Park High in Benoni have been suspended following an assault of a 14-year-old grade 8 pupil on Wednesday last week. A video that went viral on social media shows a group of girls in school uniform attacking their victim. The video has since caught the attention of Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Addressing Crystal Park High pupils on Monday, Lesufi said the madness should come to an end. "I was shocked and emotionally stressed when I saw the video. The victim was lucky that she was not harmed. What happened was a clear [case of] attempted murder. They attacked a defenceless girl who had already fell to the ground. We will not protect anyone on this issue, and we have asked the police to do their job." He told the perpetrators to apologise to their victim, adding that a psycho social unit team will pay the school a visit for counselling.
