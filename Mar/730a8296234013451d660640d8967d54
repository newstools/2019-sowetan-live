In their attempt to stave off relegation, Maccabi coach Joel Masutha expects no favours from any National First Division (NFD) club, vowing "it's only us who can save ourselves". Having gone six matches without a win, with three defeats and three draws, it was only in his seventh match in 13th placed Maccabi's seat that Masutha eventually got off the mark, earning a 1-0 victory at home against unpredictable TS Galaxy, a fortnight ago. "It's only us who can save ourselves... we don't want or expect favours at all. We are ready for the fight. I can promise you that Maccabi will survive relegation," said the Maccabi mentor. Masutha believes their win over Galaxy was a watershed in their battle to remain in the NFD next season and is confident they will build on their previous result when they travel to Durban to face Uthongathi on Sunday. "Winning against Galaxy was massive. It brought back the players' confidence. "I can say that it was a turning point we needed ... now we are positive we can keep the momentum going forward. "Uthongathi are a tricky side to play against, especially away. But I can assure you we will beat them. "They are one of the surprise packages of the season, that's for sure, but they are beatable," Masutha said.
