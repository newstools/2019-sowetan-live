Cape Town City striker Kermit Erasmus gave his coach Benni McCarthy something to ponder after his splendid 20 minute cameo against Mamelodi Sundowns. Erasmus entered the game on Wednesday to smash home a thunderous strike, a sure candidate for goal of the month. But it was too little too late for his team as Sundowns won 3-2 in Pretoria. As the Citizens prepare to take Bidvest Wits tomorrow (8.15pm), Erasmus may have forced himself into the starting 11. "Kermit came in and showed why we chased him and why we wanted him. He showed that hunger," McCarthy admitted. "As a coach you have to manage your players because we have three games in six days." After facing Wits, City will fly back home for a return against Sundowns on Tuesday. Many still see the Mother City club as having an outside chance in the league race as they are fourth on the log with 33 points - only six points behind leaders Sundowns. McCarthy, though, downplayed his team's chances of clinching the championship. "Just because people see us in fourth position they think we are title contenders. We don't see ourselves that way and don't fall into that," he said. Having counted himself out of the race, McCarthy made subtle admission the league is there for the taking.
