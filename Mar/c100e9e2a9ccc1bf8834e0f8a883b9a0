A school induction camp turned sour for a grade 8 pupil from Fons Luminus Secondary School in Diepkloof, Soweto, who was allegedly raped by three fellow pupils. The incident happened over a weekend in December. On Tuesday morning, Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi will visit the school. Provincial education spokesperson Steve Mabona said the unfortunate incident has been reported at the local police station and investigations are continuing. "The alleged perpetrators have been suspended from school. Our psycho-social team will provide counselling to the victim and other learners accordingly," Mabona said.
