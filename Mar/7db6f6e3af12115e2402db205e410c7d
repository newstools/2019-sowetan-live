It has been long since Bafana Bafana gave South Africans something to shout about from the rooftops and Sunday's game against Libya provides the perfect opportunity. Bafana are one match away from booking their ticket to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt later this year. Although Bafana need only a draw to qualify for the Afcon, the team needs to do much more than that to win back the confidence of the nation. The clash at the Stade Taieb Mhiri in Sfax (7pm), could potentially decide the future of coach Stuart Baxter. Bafana midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo feels the team knows enough about Libya to get a positive result. "We deal with the pressure by forgetting about the past and dealing with the here and now. We have played them before and we know how they want to set up," Mokotjo said. "We have had a week to prepare here and that is enough time to get the desired result in order for us to go through to Afcon." Mokotjo was in the starting line-up in the first-leg last year when Bafana were held to a goalless draw by the Libyans at home. The Brentford holding midfielder believes there is a winning mentality in the squad. "The mood has been good and the players came back from their teams in good form and that will help the national team a lot," he said. The team has been based in Tunis for the past three days and will travel to Sfax closer to the venue of the match today. Baxter confirmed that Keagan Dolly has been ruled out for the match. "Unfortunate we had a little problem with Keagan. The verdict is that he is very tight in his hamstring and he is not going to be selectable," the coach said.
