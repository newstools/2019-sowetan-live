Dan Malesela will be hoping that "third time is a charm" after leading TS Galaxy to the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup. The 53-year-old coach achieved an unlikely feat in midweek by leading Galaxy into the last four of the R7m cup. The Mpumalanga club came from behind to snatch a 2-1 win over Cape Umoya United at the Athlone Stadium and storm into the next round. In the past, Malesela has been in the semifinals of the Ke Yona Cup, with Garankuwa United in 2013 and with Chippa United in 2017. "As I said last year, one of my goals is to win a cup title and I have some unfinished business in that regard," Malesela said. "I have come close a few times in the past but that hunger and desire has not died. With every game that we will play that feeling gets stronger because now, we are closer to our target." Defender Sizwe Mdlinzo grabbed the late winner while Zakhele Lepasa banged in an equaliser after Katlego Otladisa scored for Umoya. Now, the club owned by renowned ex-football agent Tim Sukazi will be watching closely to see who will take the other three semifinal spots this weekend. Sukazi was over the moon with the accomplishment. "It's quite incredible indeed and it's a team I had to assemble very quickly. So, I had no players, no manager or coach. "We are the only team in the entire PSL who only play SA players. So we had to put the team together in a short time. The semifinal is not the end of the road; we are an ambitious side so, why can't we go all the way to the final," said Sukazi. He praised Malesela for leading the club into the semifinal in their first season of existence. "He found the team there because he joined us three games into the season. And he has taken players as young as 19 years old and done wonders."
