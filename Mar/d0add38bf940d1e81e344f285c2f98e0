Bloemfontein Celtic striker Tshegofatso Mabasa has not allowed the hype around his meteoric rise get to his head. The 22-year-old is a rising star in the Absa Premiership where, with eight league goals, he is among the leading scorers. Mabasa has worked his way up the development ranks since 2013 at Phunya Sele Sele to become the number one striker. "I have played in the MDC for a few seasons and I believe this season I have been putting the extra work in and taking my chances in games," Mabasa told Sowetan. "All that I have been doing on the side is paying off now but I need to work harder. I will keep working hard for the badge and use the opportunity I have been afforded by the club to showcase my talents." After holding league leaders Mamelodi Sundowns to a goalless draw at the weekend, Celtic will look to put up an even better performance against Orlando Pirates tonight (7.30pm). Mabasa expects a hard-fought battle, especially against his tough tackling former teammate Alfred Ndengane at the Orlando Stadium. "I know Alfred very well because I used to train with him every day. They are a formidable side but we just have to be at our best," he said. "I will just have to be smart and move around him. He is not the quickest player so I will just have to be mobile and that's how I used to give him a tough time in training. "He is really a good player and I rank him among the best in the country." Mabasa also lauded the work of co-coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka for "not changing the way we play".
