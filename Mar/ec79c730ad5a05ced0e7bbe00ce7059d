The Growthpoint Junior Nationals will take centre stage with the best young tennis players from around the country set to do battle for top honours in Mangaung from tomorrow to April 1. Play at the Free State Tennis Stadium will get under way at 9am each day, with the stage set for intense battles among the young cohorts, with all of them looking to be crowned the best in their respective age groups. The country's premier junior tennis event will be contested in four age groups namely the under 12, 14, 16 and 18 at nine premier Bloemfontein tennis venues. More than 600 juniors have entered the six-day event and some notable players include Kholo Montsi, Charl Morgan and local favourite Delien Kleinhans. Montsi, the Junior Australian Open Grand Slam participant who also had an outstanding showing at the ITF/CAT under-18 Junior Closed Championship in Marrakech, Morocco, last week, will be among the top attractions. Tournament manager Ephraim Motsiane is excited ahead of the showdown, saying: "We have 642 entrants confirmed for this year's tournament across three formats - the singles, doubles and mixed matches, which is very exciting."
