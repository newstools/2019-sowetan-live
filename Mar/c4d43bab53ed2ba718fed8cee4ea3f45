Vusi "Khekhe" Mathibela will have to wait another week before his bail application is entertained. Mathibela, 33, along with his spokesperson Elias Skhosana, 41, and business partner Stemer Monageng appeared in the Pretoria magistrate’s court on Friday to face accusations of running an extortion ring, intimidation and assault. Their matter was postponed to March 18 when Skhosana and Monageng are expected to apply for bail. However, Mathibela will not be applying for bail as he intends approaching the North Gauteng high court to challenge the lawfulness of his arrest and continued detention. The trio were arrested last week after the community of Mamelodi complained to police minister Bheki Cele last month about Mathibela's reign of terror they've been subjected to. Three other suspects believed to be Mathibela's bodyguards - Zwelibanzi Ngubane, Justice Khumalo and Asante Alfred - were arrested at the weekend and charged with possession of unlicensed firearms. They appeared in the Alexander magistrate's court on Monday and released on bail of R2,000 each. Their case was postponed to April for further investigation. The fourth suspect was released pending further investigation. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the notorious Mamelodi taxi boss handed himself over to the police in Germiston, east of Johannesburg, on Tuesday night. “On Monday, police in Mamelodi East had obtained a warrant for the arrest of Mathibela for extortion, intimidation and assault. Vusi 'Khekhe' Mathibela is alleged to have been part of a group terrorising the community of Mamelodi over a period of time,” said Naidoo.
