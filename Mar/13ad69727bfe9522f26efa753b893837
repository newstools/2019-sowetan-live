The board of Boxing SA scored an own goal by allowing unknown American-based Legends Boxing Foundation (LBF) to stage a fight in the country though it does not recognise the new sanctioning body. The bout took place in East London on March 17. Sabelo Ngebiyana won LBF's International junior bantamweight belt after stopping Sikho Nqothole in the sixth round. The fight was also for the vacant SA belt, making Ngeyibana the new national champion following his win. LBF is said to have been founded by former promoter Eva Rolle from Germany together with her son and boxer, Robert Rolle, in 2015. American Lindsey Tucker - former IBF fight supervisor - is championship chairman of the LBF. BSA chief executive Tsholofelo Lejaka, who attended the tournament, explained the boxing authority first had a teleconference with Tucker regarding his request for his organisation to be recognised by BSA. He said chapter one of the boxing act under Objectives, Clause 2(q) mentions that part of BSA's objectives is to consider the recognition of all international boxing bodies and and their champions. Lejaka added: "As part of BSA's discussions, the board of BSA therefore considered the above legislative directives, which are so vividly outlined in the SA Boxing Act, and which not only establishes BSA, but also governs how it should operate. "The board further considered what has been practised in the past years and therefore precedence in how recognition of international boxing bodies has been handled by BSA in the past." He said that the board took note of the specific request placed by Tucker's organisation and further took note of the stringent timelines that accompany such a request. As its resolution, BSA board therefore agreed to "grant provisional approval for your world body to have its championship belt as part of the mentioned tournament of 17 March, provided that the tournament itself complies with the applicable regulations in its context."
