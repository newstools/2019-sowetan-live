The University of Limpopo is planning to build a modern student centre with a food court, gym and a bar. Students staged protests last week demanding a bar on campus in Mankweng, east of Polokwane. They alleged they become victims of crime each time they leave campus to go drinking outside the university. SRC president Njabulo Mkhonto said community members attacked students outside the campus. “Every Monday we have no less than 10 cases opened at Mankweng police station after students are attacked and robbed of their belongings, including cellphones. Others are raped,” said Mkhonto. “We believe the opening of a bar inside the campus would put a stop to those cases.” University of Limpopo’s acting spokesperson, Johannes Selepe, said it had plans for a modern students centre, which would have a number of services such as the new SRC offices, food court, gymnasium and a bar. “The drawings for these facilities have been completed and the issue of the bar has been fully addressed,” Selepe said. He said the modern facilities were not unique to the university. Thabiso Mothapo, the owner of a tavern at GaThoka, opposite the university across the R37 main road, said the opening of the bar on campus would affect his business. “Should the university allow the opening of a bar inside the campus, it will be a blow to our businesses,” he said. “Students come to our taverns to drink on a daily basis and we make money out of them.” A security officer at the campus who spoke on condition of anonymity said alcohol had always been allowed inside the campus. “We used to allow students to bring alcohol into the campus on weekends. But it will be a good thing to allow alcohol to be sold inside the campus because students will be safer drinking not far from their rooms without having to be vulnerable to attacks outside,” said the security guard. frankm@sowetan.co.za
