With the big contract of Thuso Phala now off the SuperSport United wage bill, the club plans to use that surplus cash to give increases to some of their top young players. United's relationship with Phala ended in a bitter divorce last week and his contract was terminated after six years with the Tshwane side. The 32-year-old had a major fallout with the management of the club and his deal was ended before it was due to expire in June. Phala was the highest-earning player in the club's history with a monthly salary that is understood to have been about R250,000. Star players including Ronwen Williams, Teboho Mokoena and Aubrey Modiba are now set to be offered better deals. "First of all, with some of that money I want to look after the high performers in the team. Players like Ronwen, Teboho and Aubrey deserve improved packages," club chief executive Stan Matthews told Sowetan. "Only after that can we go out in the market and look to spend on reinforcing the team." Matsatsantsa a Pitori have done well under rookie coach Kaitano Tembo with the team currently fifth in the PSL with 39 points. Matthews added that in the off-season the club would go back to the method they used to find Jeremy Brockie a few seasons ago, in their search for a new striker. "We are not going to be big spenders. In June we will not be too busy... we will only be looking for a striker and a left-back," he said. "Our strategy will be the same one we used to get Jeremy. We have one more spot for a foreigner, so we will get a striker. "We also need another left- back to come in as backup for Onismor Bhasera, who has been doing well for us."
