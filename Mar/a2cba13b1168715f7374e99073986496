Football is set to change from June 1, with some rules of the game being altered. Initially, it was thought that there will be no rebounds from penalties, but this is not included in the decisions taken by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). Handballs inside the area From June 1, goals scored that have hit a player's hand - voluntarily or involuntarily - will not be allowed. "What we are looking at, particularly in attacking situations, is where the player gets a clear unfair advantage by gaining possession or control of the ball, as a result of it making contact with their hand or arm," IFAB technical director David Elleray said. Substituted players can leave the field anywhere When a player is withdrawn, they will no longer have to leave the field at the halfway line and will instead be permitted to leave the pitch at the nearest point. "This will ensure that there's less time-wasting," said a PSL referee yesterday, who didn't want to be named because he had not been given permission by the SA Football Association. No attacking players in the wall This rule prohibits attacking players standing in the wall when a free-kick is taken. Coaches will receive cards again The discipline of coaches has been reprimands or a sending off. From next season, they'll receive yellow and red cards much like players.
