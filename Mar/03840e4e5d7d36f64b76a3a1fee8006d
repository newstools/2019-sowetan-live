Police in Polokwane have launched a manhunt for a suspect who stole a car belonging to a local magistrate at an overnight accommodation last month. It is alleged that the 44-year-old magistrate had booked into the establishment with a female companion whom he allegedly met earlier in town. Police spokesperson Constable Maphure Manamela said it is understood that the victim had passed out in his room after drinking something. "It is suspected the drink might have been spiked. He was awoken by the employees at around 7am [the next day] and that's when he realised that his cellphone and a motor vehicle, a BMW 3 series, had been stolen. His companion had also disappeared. The stolen vehicle was found abandoned in Soshanguve, in Pretoria, a week later," said Manamela. The police are appealing to the woman last seen with the magistrate to come forward and assist with the investigation.
