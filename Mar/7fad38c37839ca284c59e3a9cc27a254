EFF leader Julius Malema says white people have blood on their hands for the massacre of black people in Sharpeville 59 years ago. Speaking at Dlomo Dam in Sharpeville, Malema said reconciliation does not exist. "Today is a day we are fighting for the rights of black people; we must not make any apology about that. "This nonsense of non-racialism that they are spreading in defence of white privilege ... we are not part of that nonsense. What Human Rights Day?" asked Malema. The red berets leader said his party was willing to lose the elections on May 8 for speaking the truth. Malema appealed to the elderly to vote for the EFF to ensure that it distributes land to those in need. He said voting for president Cyril Ramaphosa on May 8 would be a mistake as he "sold out comrades during the Struggle".
