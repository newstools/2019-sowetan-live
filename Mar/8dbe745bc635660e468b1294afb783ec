Students from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban set several beds alight and threw furniture from a university residence on Thursday night. The protest broke out in Hospital Road‚ near Durban’s South Beach. “Students are burning the beds they are using. They are not fighting with anyone‚” police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele told SowetanLIVE. Students were also throwing glass bottles and set a fridge alight in the road. A fridge was also flung from the building. Mbele said no case had been opened. She could not confirm if the situation was tense. “Police are on the scene‚” Mbele said. Two weeks ago‚ students said they were fed up with the poor condition of their beds and embarked on a strike. To voice their frustration‚ they burnt metal bed frames.
