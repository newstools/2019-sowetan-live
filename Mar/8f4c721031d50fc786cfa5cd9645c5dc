Bafana Bafana players are not expecting incentives bonanza for qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), but Safa will work out a bonus structure for the tournament. Bafana players will receive their usual R60,000 bonus for their 2-1 win over Libya but will not be financially rewarded for qualification itself. Safa acting chief executive Russell Paul confirmed that the organisation would engage the players before the tournament in June. "The players knew they had a job to do and were not focused on money before qualifying," Paul said. "Now that they qualified, it's a different situation and there will be a bonus structure in terms of Afcon itself. They will receive the normal bonus for the win." Depending on how far they go in the tournament, Bafana could be in a huge cash windfall at Afcon. The winner of the tournament will pocket a staggering $4m (R60m) prize money while the quarterfinalists will each receive $800,000 (R11m). The 24 teams that have qualified will know their fate on April 12 at the draw for the group stages. Paul said the next step would be for coach Stuart Baxter to hand in his report on the qualifying process. "The coach will submit a technical report to the technical committee who will make a submission to the NEC. "We will then look at the draw and after that we will know where we are playing and who we will be playing and plan around that." With Bafana having found success in North Africa, Paul feels it was good that the team has experienced the hostile environment up there. "Whether we will go to camp in UAE, Saudi Arabia or Qatar will be decided. "For them to have undergone this type of hostile reception [against Libya] builds character and they were very united. I think now they know what to expect."
