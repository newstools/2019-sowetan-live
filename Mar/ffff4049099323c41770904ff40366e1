Five Life Esidimeni patients have been located over the past two weeks. This was announced by Gauteng health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa on Sunday during a visit to one of the patients in Lenasia, southern Johannesburg. The patient, Georgie van der Merwe, 60, has been living with the Lenasia family for the past two years but the department was only able to locate him in the past two weeks. Ramokgopa said one patient was in Soweto, others in Weskoppies, Zuurbekom and Ekurhuleni. "Out of the pain and tragedy of Life Esidimeni, these are positive outcomes," said a relieved Ramokgopa. She added that it had been difficult to locate patients because there were no proper records. There are now 16 psychiatric patients yet to be located, down Â from 100.
