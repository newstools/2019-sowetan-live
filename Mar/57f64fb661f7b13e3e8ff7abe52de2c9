Social media had mixed reactions to what many have called a theatrical performance by Gqom artist Mandla Mampintsha Maphumulo after he gave his account of what happened on the night he allegedly assaulted Bongekile Simelane who is known as  Babes Wodumo. Many social media users remained supportive of the wololo hit maker who is still reportedly recovering from the incident. However some social media users seemed to believe Mampintsha’s side of events.
