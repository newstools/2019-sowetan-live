President Cyril Ramaphosa together with acting Gauteng premier and basic education MEC Panyaza Lesufi officially opened the newly built “state-of-the-art” Booysens magistrate’s court in Oakdene, Johannesburg, on Thursday. The court offers a range of services and is equipped with a fully fledged sexual offences court. It is also equipped to support victims of gender-based violence and femicide with children-friendly consulting rooms. The building has 10 courtrooms that offer sexual offences, family law, small claims, civil and criminal court services. The court is expected to play a key role in alleviating the demand for services at the Johannesburg magistrate's court. The president started the day by taking a tour around the court and inspected the privately located consulting room for violated women and children. Ramaphosa was also taken to the sexual offences court where court proceedings involving a minor were demonstrated for him. Ramaphosa also signed a Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) Declaration with civil society organisations' representatives. The declaration comes after the National Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Summit held in November last year in an effort to find solutions to the scourge of gender-based violence and femicide.
