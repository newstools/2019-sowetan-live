Sowetan analyses the two keepers' performances in national colours. Keet The Bidvest Wits shot-stopper has featured in nine matches for Bafana since his debut about five years ago. Keet, 29, has four clean sheets and has conceded nine goals, which is an average of one goal per match. He's played in a couple of big matches, including the 3-1 defeat to Algeria at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Williams He's not had the best of times with the national team, though he has been one of the best goalkeepers in the PSL over the years. The SuperSport United keeper made his Bafana debut in the 5-0 trashing by Brazil in a friendly at FNB Stadium in 2014. Since then, he's made a total of six appearances and kept one clean sheet, which was in the goalless draw against New Zealand. The 27-year-old has played five friendlies and one World Cup qualifier against Cape Verde Islands, which Bafana lost 2-1 away in 2017. Verdict: It's debatable who should start, but perhaps the fact that Keet has played more official matches, with three compared to one for Williams, gives him the edge. Bafana Bafana have played mostly friendlies at the homes of North African opposition over the years and have a decent record. Bafana take on Libya in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Sfax, Tunisia, on Sunday. This is where Libya have played their home games because of the security situation in their own country. Following is Bafana's record from the matches they have played away in North African, which includes two wins, two draws and two defeats: 2003 Egypt 2-1 SA (friendly) Tunisia 2-0 SA (friendly) 2004 Tunisia 0-2 SA (friendly) 2006 Egypt 1-2 SA (friendly) 2011 Egypt 0-0 SA (Afcon qualifier) 2013 Morocco 1-1 SA (friendly).
