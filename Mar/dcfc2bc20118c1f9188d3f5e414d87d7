Early winter rain has fallen across most of the Western Cape‚ including the province's drought-affected areas. The Gouritz River catchment area that covers the bulk of the Karoo region has seen an increase in average dam levels for the first time this year. That average level currently stands at 19.3%. This includes the Gamka Dam in Beaufort West‚ which is currently 9.4% full. The dam had been empty for more than two years. Its catchment area received 13mm of rain over the past seven days‚ said Anton Bredell the MEC for local government‚ environmental affairs and development planning. "The rainfall is not without its challenges. As at 11.45am this morning‚ the N2 has been closed between Caledon and Riviersonderend due to flooding‚" said Bredell on Monday. "There have been several other incidents of localised flooding in some areas across the province. This is expected to continue another day or two." In addition‚ there is a possibility of hail in some parts of the province‚ including the Karoo. The average water level for all dams in the Western Cape currently stands at 39.8% -considerably higher than the 2018 average of just 19.5% - although Bredell noted that this figure would exclude the heavy rainfall experienced over the past few days. Dams supplying the City of Cape Town currently stand at an average of 51.6%‚ also well up from the 2018 figure of 22.7%.
