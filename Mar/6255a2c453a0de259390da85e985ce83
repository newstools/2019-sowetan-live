The star state witness in the Timothy Omotoso trial, Cheryl Zondi, is briefing the media after the presiding judge in the case, Mandela Makaula, officially recused himself. Makaula recused himself on Friday because of his concerns over perceptions of bias because his wife owns a guesthouse where state witnesses were accommodated.
