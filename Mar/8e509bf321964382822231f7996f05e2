The events in the Babes Wodumo assault case have taken a turn as the alleged perpetrator, Mampintsha, has laid a counter-charge. On Tuesday, his legal representative Pat Magwaza told eNCA outside the Westville police station in Durban - where he is being held in custody - that he had laid a counter assault charge against his girlfriend Bongekile Simelane, popularly known as Babes Wodumo. “… he had to come here [police station] as well to open a case against Bongekile Simelane. Luckily, on the day of the incident he came here in the early hours of the morning, around 7/ 8, and wrote a statement which we found even today,” Magwaza said. Mampintsha was expected to appear in the Pinetown magistrate’s court on Tuesday after Babes Wodumo laid an assault charge against him on Monday. The assault was captured on a video clip making rounds on social media - showing Mampintsha repeatedly slapping Babes in a room. “He was assaulted, so he has opened a charge of assault against Bongekile Simelane. From what I’ve heard from him, yes it was before the video because he was then defending himself when the video was made,” said Magwaza during the eNCA interview. Magwaza also refuted claims that his client had been in hiding and said Mampintsha in fact handed himself over to the police.
