Having eclipsed last year's benchmark, Black Leopards striker Mwape Musonda has expressed confidence that he will bag more goals before the end of the season. Musonda scored a hat-trick to power Leopards to a come-from-behind 3-2 win over Chippa United in Thohoyandou on Sunday. The Zambian surged up the charts to be the outright leading scorer in the Absa Premiership with 12 goals. The 27-year-old has now surpassed the 11 goals scored by last season's top scorers Percy Tau and Rodney Ramagalela. "I am happy to have scored 12 goals even though I think I can do better. We still have eight games to go so we just have to keep pushing," Musonda said. "What was important is that the team got the points. Yes I got the hat-trick but I am pleased that we won." Lidoda Duvha grabbed their first win after a poor run of three losses and two draws in all competition. The victory has given them some breathing space on the log as they now lie 12th with 25 points. "We have been hurting ourselves because we haven't been putting the goals away," he said. "In all our games we allowed the opponent to hit us first. We have to get going from the [first] whistle." Leopards coach Dylan Kerr has praised his top striker but wants to get more from him. "I said to him that his job is to score goals and he should be in and around the penalty box," he said. "He should be scoring at least two goals a game. I will keep pushing him in training."
