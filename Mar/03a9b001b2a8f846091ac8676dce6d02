Gqom star Babes Wodumo this evening laid a charge of assault against her boyfriend and kwaito hit maker Mampintsha. This was confirmed by Babes father, Reverend Welcome Simelane, this evening. Simelane told the Sowetan that that “we as a family did go to the police station to lay a charge of assault against Mampintsha”. Following the case being opened, police have called on Mampintsha to turn himself in at the Westville police station in Durban in connection with the assault of Babes. The police have called on music star Mampintsha to turn himself in at the Westville Police Station in connection with the assault of Gqom star Babes Wodumo. National police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo on Monday evening would not be drawn into confirming whether Babes, real name Bongekile Simelane, had opened a case against her boyfriend Mandla ‘Mampintsha’ Maphumulo. Babes was on Sunday seen on an Instagram live video – which was later deleted – being assaulted both physically and verbally by Mampintsha. Naidoo said the police were inviting Mampintsha to the police station, based outside Durban, to assist the law enforcement agents with the case. “We will not confirm or deny whether a case has been opened as it poses a risk. However, her partner, we are asking him to come forward as it would assist us with the investigation,” Naidoo said. Earlier in the day, the police confirmed that they were looking into assault video. "The said video is currently being analysed‚ primarily to establish and verify the identities of those in the video‚" Naidoo said. "However‚ in the meantime‚ the national commissioner had ordered police to trace the whereabouts of Ms Wodumo so that a statement can be obtained from her and a case opened if indeed it is her that is being assaulted in the video."
