SuperSport United midfielder Aubrey Modiba believes the recent return of key players from injury that has revived his team will also boost Bafana Bafana. Matsatsantsa a Pitori, who have been ravaged by injuries this season, have recently welcomed back Dean Furman, Bradley Grobler and Thabo Mnyamane from the sidelines. The Tshwane side have improved their performance with three wins from their last four games in the league. Modiba, Furman and Grobler, who are regular national team players, could be called upon for Bafana's crucial Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya on March 24. "As you know we have struggled a lot with injuries this season and it has been good to see some of our important players make a return from injury," Modiba said. "Since they have been back we've had three wins in a row. I think their return will also help us in the national team in the last game against Libya." The 23-year-old attacker last received a national team call-up against Seychelles. "Afcon is a big deal and if we want to be taken seriously as a country, we must be playing in its every edition," he said. "I know that in the national team I have to show that I bring something different. Modiba says he has been doing his best to impress Bafana coach Stuart Baxter. "I want to represent my country and help the team qualify. I have to prove to the coach whenever I play for SuperSport."
