State-owned rail service has placed three executives on special leave and suspended another while allegations of corruption and mismanagement are dealt with, it said. In a statement, Nkosinathi Sishi, CEO of The Passenger Rail Agency SA, said the board had taken the decision to ensure a “fair process” around the allegations, which have dogged the agency for years. All four of the employees were still being paid, Sipho Sithole, strategy officer at PRASA, told Reuters via WhatsApp. The allegations, which span improper, corrupt and wasteful expenditure, are being investigated by South Africa’s Public Protector, which is also looking into similar accusations at other state-owned firms. PRASA declined to give contact details for any of the executives or their legal representation.
