Having already won two reserve league titles, Golden Arrows striker Nkosikhona Dube has explained why it's significant for them to now win the MultiChoice Diski Shield (MDS). As they were crowned champions in the 2015/16 and 2017/18 seasons, Abafana Bes'thende are the only club boasting two MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) titles in the competition's five years of existence. In the first round of the MDS, teams are grouped into four pools. Top finishers across all the four groups will battle it out in the semifinals. Arrows are in Group D alongside AmaZulu, Maritzburg United and Chippa United. The Durbanites began their campaign on a high note, humiliating Chippa 6-1 at Princess Magogo Stadium at the weekend. Siboniso Conco's double brace and a goal apiece from Mfanafuthi Mkhize and Thando Khwela sealed it for Arrows. "We want to win this knockout cup because we've tasted the league triumph twice already. After failing to defend the MDC this season, the Shield is a perfect opportunity to redeem ourselves," Dube told Sowetan yesterday. Dube, 19, was included in Amajita's 75-man Fifa World Cup provisional squad. The lanky striker from Stanger, in KwaZulu-Natal, has vowed to use the MDS platform to impress to make the final Under-20 squad. "I am waiting for a call to assemble for camp. It's my dream to play in the World Cup. The aim is to bang in as many goals in the Shield, this is a huge platform to fight for a a spot in the World Cup squad," Dube said. The Under-20 World Cup will be hosted by Poland from May 23-June 15 this year. SA are in Group F alongside Portugal, South Korea and Argentina.
