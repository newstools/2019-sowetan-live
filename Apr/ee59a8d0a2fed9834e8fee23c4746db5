The case against a former Bryanston High School sports coach accused of sexually harassing three pupils is set to continue in the Alexandra Magistrate's Court on Monday. He last appeared in court last month when the state requested a postponement, saying it still needed a chance to obtain statements from three potential witnesses. The accused is a 33-year-old who was dismissed from the school on March 1 following a disciplinary hearing at which he was found guilty of sexually harassing the three pupils, as well as financial mismanagement. He is currently out on bail. Following the postponement, Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMaca) called for there to be no more delays in the case, highlighting that it had first been heard in court in January. "As much as we hope for a swift trial and a strong sentence, we also hope that the grooming of his victims will come to light so that we can all learn more about the dangerous tactics that abusers (who are entrusted with the protection of children) employed to get access to children in order to abuse them," the organisation said in a statement.
