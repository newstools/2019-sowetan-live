A Soweto boyfriend handed himself over to the police on Tuesday morning after allegedly strangling his 24-year-old girlfriend to death on Sunday. Yolanda Dlephu (24) from Dobsonville died on Sunday afternoon after years of allegedly being in an abusive relationship with the man. She was allegedly strangled by her boyfriend at his home in Zola. The woman is said to have stayed on with her 30-year-old boyfriend although he has allegedly been beating her up for over three years. Police spokesperson Sergeant Phindlile Mavuso said the man was on the run from Sunday afternoon after the incident. “He handed himself over around 6am this morning (Tuesday) after confessing to his mother and realising that police were looking for him,” said Mavuso. Mavuso told Sowetan that the body of the woman was found on the floor in the man’s backroom with strangle marks on the neck and bruises all over the body. Mavuso said investigation has revealed that Dlephu had previously opened two cases of assault against her boyfriend and also had a protection order against him. “We have a challenge with youngsters between the ages of 18 and 31 who come and open cases of assault after being beaten up by their boyfriends but come back later to drop the charges.” Mavuso said women need to take assault seriously and leave abusive relationships while they still have time. “Unfortunately for Yolanda, it’s too late," said Mavuso.
