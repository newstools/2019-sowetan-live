The local football fraternity has rallied behind Mamelodi Sundowns in their quest to advance to the semifinals of the CAF Champions League. The Brazilians are proudly representing the country in this premier African competition where they are among the favourites to lift the title. Downs are in pole position to progress to the last four following their 5-0 demolition of Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the first-leg quarterfinal in Atteridgeville last weekend. All they have to do is to ensure that the Red Devils do not pull off a miracle in the second leg at the Borg El Arab Stadium, in Alexandria, tomorrow night (6pm). PSL chairman Irvin Khoza threw his weight behind the Chloorkop-based side to make the country proud. "They have represented the country very well. We are rooting for Sundowns and for the brand PSL," Khoza said. "It's not easy in the CAF because it's so competitive. With their 5-0 win over Al Ahly, they showed that our football is on par with the best in Africa, if not better." SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo feels their Tshwane neighbours have demonstrated that they're one of the best teams on the African continent. "Sundowns have a lot of experience in the Champions League and are now well known around the continent," said Tembo, whose team were Confederation Cup finalists in 2017. "The technical team has a quality squad at their disposal and it is not a surprise to see them doing well." Pitso Mosimane is looking to lead the team to their second CAF title after winning the tournament for the first time in 2016. Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic believes Ahly will throw players forward and that will open up gaps for Downs to score. "I don't know how many people they will allow at the stadium. The opponents will need to risk and come out," Sredojevic opined. "The speed of Sundowns players needs to provide the space behind to score a goal and then everything will be buried. The best way of defending will be by jealously possessing the ball."
