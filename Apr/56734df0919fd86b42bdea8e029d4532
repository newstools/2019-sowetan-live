Being the only team in the league that boasts a finishing coach in Stephan Adams has always put Orlando Pirates in the spotlight whenever they miss clear-cut chances. Pirates should have demolished Black Leopards at home on Wednesday, but their poor finishing let them down once again despite winning 2-0. Their joint top scorers, Thembinkosi Lorch and Justin Shonga, who have managed 11 goals apiece thus far in all competitions, were the guiltiest parties against Leopards, as they wasted numerous easy chances. Nevertheless, Lorch, who scored the second goal to add to Luvuyo Memela's strike against the Limpopo side, has urged patience and promised they were working hard to improve their unconvincing conversion rate, especially in the race for league honours. "We always do extra training. Even on Friday [today] we will have a finishing session. We must be patient. it's not going to come now, but it will come," vowed Lorch. The winger, who's among those touted for the coveted PSL player of the season gong, still holds their finishing specialist Adams in high regard. Lorch also pledged his support to Shonga after the Zambian-born striker was booed for his misses against Lidoda Duvha. "With coach Stephen Adams doing finishing training, I am positive. He is a qualified coach and soon people will see his hard work through us, as attackers scoring many goals," said Lorch. "Shonga must keep on working. we support him as a team. It happens in football that you miss chances, but that does not make you a bad player." Though he has been part of the recent Bafana Bafana squads, Lorch has found it rather hard to command a regular berth in the national team. The lad from Bloemfontein is eager to win the heart of Bafana coach Stuart Baxter going forward. "Firstly, I have to do well for my team. then my chance will come in the national team. When it comes, I will make sure that I grab it with both hands,'' said left-sided winger Lorch.
