In a departure from tradition‚ the inauguration of the country’s president-elect following the May 8 elections will be held at Loftus Versveld Stadium in Tshwane instead of the Union Buildings‚ the presidency announced on Saturday. The inauguration will take place on Saturday‚ May 25‚ it said. “Hosting the inauguration in a stadium‚ the largest in the City of Tshwane‚ will allow for greater public participation in this important national event‚” said presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko. She said it was symbolic that the inauguration would take place on Africa Day‚ as it affirmed government’s commitment to advancing the African agenda and to strengthening ties between South Africa and its neighbours. The theme of the inauguration ceremony will be “Together celebrating 25 years of freedom: Renewal and Growth for a better South Africa”. “Aside from members of the public‚ it is expected that heads of state and royalty from a number of countries will attend‚ as well as religious representatives‚ political parties‚ and representatives from regional‚ continental and international organisations and bodies such as the Southern African Development Community‚ the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN)‚” Diko said.
