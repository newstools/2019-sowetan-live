The Gauteng department of education is to launch an engineering school with an automotive focus where learners will be trained how to build the new BMW X3. To make this a reality‚ BMW South Africa has donated at least one of its X3 models to the new Soshanguve Engineering School of Specialisation (SoS) to assist with educational purposes‚ said the department’s spokesperson‚ Steve Mabona. "We are excited about our partnership with BMW SA‚ who donated and will hand over one of its first model X3s to the school for educational gain to our learners. Among others‚ they will also support the school with training services and material. This is revolution and quality education we are advocating for which learners will benefit from‚" said MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Lesufi is expected to launch the school on Tuesday in a bid to nurture talent in young people across key disciplines. "SoS (schools of specialisation) are intended to respond to the skills shortage and unemployment crisis among the youth in the country. It is envisaged that SoS would equip learners with the skills and knowledge to give them the best chance of success in life‚” said Mabona The department said industry and private partnerships were of paramount importance in addressing unemployment and skill shortages as they provide learners with workplace experience‚ learnerships‚ artisanship and entrepreneurial skills.
