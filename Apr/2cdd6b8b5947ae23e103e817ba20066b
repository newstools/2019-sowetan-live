In a week where Mamelodi Sundowns needed to focus all their attention on their crucial clash against Al Ahly, coach Pitso Mosimane has admitted that the recent guilty verdict from the PSL was a thorn in the flesh. Sundowns are facing a points deduction in the Absa Premiership after being found guilty of fielding an ineligible player. In midweek, PSL prosecutor Nande Becker found Sundowns guilty of illegally fielding Wayne Arendse against Bidvest Wits in October. Arendse was fielded despite not being on the match-day squad in the 1-1 draw. Mosimane was also found guilty of assaulting AmaZulu security officer Satchmo Ngwenya after their match in September. "These things pop up any time, any day. We need to make sure we win our games. But also, nobody is guaranteed to win their games," he said. "I don't want to worry about what I can't control. If we have to lose the league because of that (points deduction), it's okay. At least we gave it our all." He continued: "The guy whom I supposedly assaulted has spoken about it and he doesn't say I beat him up ... " Mosimane perhaps faces his toughest test yet as a tactician against Al Ahly in the quarterfinals of the premier African competition at the Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (3pm). The former Bafana Bafana boss admits that this is the mother of all games for his team. "It's a big club, hey? We will have to tread carefully but what's important is to play the same way we have been playing," he said. "We need to take the game to them. They are smart and highly technical and have big individual players. "They have good movements and look after the ball. A perfect team in terms of play." The Brazilians will be chasing their first win over the Egyptians after two losses and two draws.
