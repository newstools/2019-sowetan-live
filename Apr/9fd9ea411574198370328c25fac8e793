The Hawks arrested three of their own in Pretoria on Friday for their alleged involvement in crimes related to corruption, extortion, intimidation and defeating the ends of justice. The members were aged between 49 and 55. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said it was alleged that the three officers had visited a business premises in January where they allegedly extorted a large sum of money from the business owner. They took the money in exchange for not reporting the business for being in possession of false documents relating to doing business in the country, said Mulaudzi. The two captains and a warrant officer were expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Friday. Mulaudzi said investigations were continuing.
