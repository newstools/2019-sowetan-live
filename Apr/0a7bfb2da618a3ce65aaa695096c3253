A visibly emotional Black Leopards coach Dylan Kerr has lashed out at his troops for laughing and shaking hands with  Orlando Pirates players post their 2-0 loss at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday. Luvuyo Memela and Thembinkosi Lorch struck on either half of the match to put the relegation-threatened Leopards to the sword and further into relegation terrain. The behaviour of his players after the match left Kerr disappointed and angry. The annoyed Kerr suggested the Lidoda Duvha troops' conduct - joking around with Pirates players - showed they do not understand the seriousness of the situation they are in. "What angers me it's... after the game I am going around  looking at the players, to see reaction and it’s all laughter and jokes. Its all high fives and handshakes with the Pirates players and big smiles on their faces," Kerr said. "If they want to play in the NFD next year, it's their choice. I mean I am absolutely devastated losing that game, maybe that’s me being British...I don’t mean that as an offence to African players, but I am absolutely devastated. I am angry, my players are smiling... high fives." After the game Leopards midfielder Lehlogonolo Masalesa, formerly of Pirates,  was seen cracking jokes with ex teammate Thamsanqa Gabuza. Perhaps this was the incident that angered Lidoda Duvha coach the most. "Yes it's your former teammates, yes they are good friends...I like that but when you leave the ground go straight from the final whistle. That pains me as a former NSL player, I just don't get it (why his players were smiling in the wake of the defeat at Orlando Stadium)," Kerr noted. Leopards hope to return to winning ways when they host another Soweto heavyweights in the form of Kaizer Chiefs at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday.
