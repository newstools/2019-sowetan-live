 Bad customer service is a frustrating experience for everyone, but who would think of crashing their car into a building?A woman in Boksburg drove her vehicle into a Standard Bank branch after apparently waiting for several hours to be served. The woman crashed the Mercedes Benz into the glass walls of the branch after she had an argument with a bank teller regarding money withdrawal, News24 reported. In a statement from Standard Bank obtained by SowetanLIVE's sister publication TimesLIVE, the bank would not give details about the incident but only said that "the client was served in a professional manner and in line with client-service procedures. The query was of a complex nature." The bank said that while nobody was hurt, counselling had been offered to those affected by the incident.
