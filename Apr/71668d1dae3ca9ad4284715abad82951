Two schoolboys from Mokopane have been arrested in connection with the murder of their schoolmate, Limpopo police said on Sunday. The pair was arrested after the 17-year-old girl’s body was found on Saturday morning at a dump site. "The intensive police investigations resulted in the arrests of the two suspects, aged 17 and 18. They are both learners at the same high school where the deceased was attending," police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. He did not immediately reveal how the suspects were linked to the crime. The parents of the 17-year-old victim had told police that they had last seen their daughter when she left for school on Friday morning. She did not come home. "On Saturday at about 10.15am, a passerby noticed the victim lying on the ground in the dumping site. She was still wearing her school uniform,” said Ngoepe. The victim was identified by her family. The two suspects are expected to appear in the Mokopane Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
