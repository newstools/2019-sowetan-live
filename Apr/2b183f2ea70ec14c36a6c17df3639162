Orlando Pirates midfielder Musa Nyatama believes this is the moment of truth for his team as they look to make a dash for the Premier Soccer League title. The Buccaneers could take an outright lead in the league race when they face Black Leopards at the Orlando Stadium tonight (7.30pm). They are currently tied with Mamelodi Sundowns at the top of the table on 44 points. Nyatama wants his team to open up some breathing room over their title rivals from Chloorkop. "It would mean a lot to take the lead over Sundowns. This is a crucial time in the league and now there are five games remaining," Nyatama said. "Each and every game from now on is like a cup final. The Wits win boosted our spirit a lot and it has come at a right time. It was not easy but a win is a win, even though people can say that it was not deserved." That points haul against Wits - secured in the last minute via a Keegan Ritchie own goal - was the turnaround in fortunes that the club needed as pressure was mounting on them after a string of underwhelming performances. The 31-year-old feels that their achilles heel has been their failure to convert the many scoring chances they create in games. "Our only problem has been goalscoring but we have been playing good football. I believe we will get there and this is something that we have been working on," he said. While the former Bloemfontein Celtic ace is pleased to welcome back playmaker Thembinkosi Lorch from suspension, he is wary of Leopards' in-form striker Mwape Musonda, who is the league's leading scorer with 13 goals. "Musonda can punish us if we are not careful. He is a very good player and there are other great guys [at Leopards] so it won't be easy."
