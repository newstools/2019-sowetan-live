The case commenced at 10am on Tuesday and Mpofana's attorney began making submissions for his client to receive bail. Myeza's attorney then began with his submissions before proceedings were brought to a close." The official said that the court was packed and members of Magaqa's family were present. A KZN National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson confirmed that the case was postponed to April 16 and 17 for further evidence and resumption of the bail applications. Myeza, Mpofana and Ncalane are facing one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder of councillors Jabu Msiya and Nontsikelelo Mafu. The state previously provisionally withdrew charges against Harry Gwala district mayor Mluleki Ndobe and Harry Gwala district municipal manager Zwelibanzi Sikhosana, who had been implicated in the case.
