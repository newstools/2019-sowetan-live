There has been no schooling at Oakdale Secondary  in Ennerdale, south of Joburg,  for  days after parents  shut down the school fearing for the safety of pupils. The parents accuse the Gauteng department of education  of failing  to fix school infrastructure, including  a roof that was damaged during a storm last year. On Monday,  the school governing body (SGB) took a decision to stop  learning. The   roof of  four classrooms was ripped off by the storm and pupils were forced to use temporary containers but these are also  in poor condition. Ranleigh Delport, chair of the Ennerdale Gauteng Shutdown Coordinating Committee, said there can be no normal learning in an abnormal school. The parents decided that only the grade 12s will continue with their lessons so as to prepare for their exams. There has been no schooling for grades 8-11 since Monday. SGB chair Jacky Schutte said: "We have requested the department to provide us with new temporary classrooms and also get the roofing for the four classrooms fixed." Gauteng education spokesperson Steve Mabona said the department had started  procuring the service provider  to do the work and another to  remove the mobile classes. "We appeal to members of the community not to shut down the school as any time lost will be challenging for us  to recover."
