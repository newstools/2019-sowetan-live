Five people are expected to appear in the Lindley Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after violence erupted in the small farming town of Steynsrus, in the Free State. Police spokesperson captain Stephen Thakeng said that about 300 residents barricaded the roads with burning tyres, four green JoJo water tanks and rocks. He said protesters had pelted passing cars with rocks on Monday evening. Protesters had later attacked security officers and residents, and stoned police officers' houses. Thakeng said there was also an attempt to burn a disability care centre in Matlwangtlwang. Four men and one woman were arrested for public violence. Last week, protesters torched three trucks on the R76 between Steynsrus and Kroonstad. Protesters in Kroonstad had also set alight a post office and two vehicles which belonged to the municipality. They smashed windows at the local municipal offices. More than 60 people were arrested for public violence.
