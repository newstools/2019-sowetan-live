Police said that members of the Johannesburg Flying Squad had responded to a call to be on the lookout for a Ford Fiesta involved in an attempted robbery at a shop in the Eastgate Mall.

The suspects drove into Eastgate Shopping Centre parking area where they were cornered by the police and arrested," police said. They said the arrested suspects would appear in the Germiston Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.
