Baroka striker Jemondre Dickens says there's no cause for panic despite the team being 15th on the Absa Premiership log with six matches remaining. The 20-year-old has three goals from 14 league outings for Bakgaga and believes he'd be ready when called upon. Baroka face Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday and Dickens insists they will still play their normal game despite the pressures of the axe hovering over them. "No, we are not panicking. Now we are actually more confident, because we've got our mindset right," Dickens said. "These are the last six games so we [need to] go all out; there's no turning back. "The position we are in is not good for us, especially because I believe we play good football," he continued. Dickens insisted: "It's not like we are not a proper team. We are a proper team. We can play and we can beat any team, it's just that we need to stay together and build our confidence." Dickens was part of the team that lost 3-0 to neighbours Polokwane City at Thohoyandou Stadium in Vhembe, Limpopo, in the opening round of the MultiChoice Diski Shield. He said appearing there will aid with his fitness at the recommendation of the technical team. Meanwhile, Dickens was recently called up to the U23 national team that played and won 6-1 on aggregate against Angola in the CAF U23 Cup of Nations qualifiers. He lost his place after he was left behind when the team travelled to Luanda for the first leg after it was discovered that he doesn't have a passport. "It's all my fault. If I was prepared and knew that I had to get a passport and everything, I was gonna get it." "I'm not disappointed. There are still more games. Since I couldn't go, now I'm going to work even harder to get in the national team, because there are more games still to come."
