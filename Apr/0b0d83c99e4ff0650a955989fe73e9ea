The CCMA matter between Ndalo Media and its former employees has been taken for arbitration after its owner, Khanyi Dhlomo, failed to show up for the second time. Dhlomo and her former employees are in dispute over unpaid severance packages as well as the decision to retrench staff and then later liquidate the company before negotiations were concluded. According to a source, who did not want to be named for fear of victimisation, this decision meant employees could end up getting "10c to a rand". Several employees who had been with Dhlomo for years were told they could get as little as R12,000. The matter was, on April 8, postponed after Dhlomo failed to show up. The commissioner elevated the matter to arbitration after she did not pitch again on Monday. The agitated employees told Sowetan outside the CCMA offices that they were frustrated by her no-show as they wanted their money. "They are challenging the severance packages and are also trying to stop the liquidation process. If we get liquidated, we're going to get less," said the source. At least 20 former Ndalo employees showed up at the CCMA hearing but the matter could not go through. It is not clear why Dhlomo has been failing to show up to the hearings. The employees have also accused Dhlomo of not following proper processes in dealing with their pensions and Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). "I tried to go get my pension and I couldn't," said the source. "We also want to go to Sars [South African Revenue Service] because we believe she wasn't paying our pension, UIF and PAYE, but they were being deducted from our salaries every month. Where was the money going?"
