The man who allegedly defrauded Eskom out of more than a million rands has handed himself over to the police, the Hawks confirmed on Thursday. Michael Chimanzi, 56, allegedly defrauded the embattled power utility out of approximately R1.3m. Mpumalanga Hawks spokesperson Capt Dineo Sekgotodi said Chimanzi had handed himself over on Thursday morning. "He told the investigating officer that he saw on television that he is needed. He came with his lawyer," Sekgotodi said. He is expected to appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate's Court. Sekgotodi said the alleged crimes were committed between 2013 and 2014. Chimanzi allegedly submitted fraudulent invoices, which Eskom paid. Sekgotodi said the work was "never rendered".
