A Limpopo man faces arrest for threatening journalists at the funeral of his daughter who was allegedly run over by a bakkie driven by her brother. Jonas Seanego hurled insults at a Sowetan reporter and threated to assault the newspaper's photographer during the funeral of Mathapelo Seanego in Dipere village, Bakenberg, near Mokopane. Mathapelo was allegedly killed by her brother who was driving their father's car last week without a valid driver's licence. According to police, Seanego allegedly tried to protect his son by concealing the vehicle that was being driven by his son. He is now facing a charge of defeating the ends of justice. On Saturday, the enraged father lost his cool when he saw Sowetan journalists at the funeral of his daughter, and had to be restrained by the community from assaulting the newspaper crew. Seanego later vented his anger at the grave diggers who had blocked him from attacking the journalists. A case of intimidation has since been opened by the reporter. Yesterday, police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that Seanego would face the law for threatening journalists. "The man will be directly arrested for intimidating journalists and an update on the progress of the case will be provided to you," said Ngoepe. A meeting has also been scheduled for tomorrow in the village where Seanego will be expected to appear before the local headman to answer for his conduct.
