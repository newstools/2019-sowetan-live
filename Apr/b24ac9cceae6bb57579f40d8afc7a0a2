Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp cut a relaxed figure before and during training at the club's base in Naturena yesterday. Despite the fact that Chiefs are eight points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in the league race, the German isn't showing any sign of trouble. It could be that Chiefs won their last match, which was a Nedbank Cup quarterfinal clash against Cape Town City. They beat the Citizens 2-0 at Mbombela Stadium this past weekend. But with an outside chance in the league, the expectation to surprise all and come from behind to win the league could be weighing on his shoulders, especially being in charge of SA's most supported side. Middendorp, however, believes if you put in the work, there's no need to be anxious and with Chiefs facing Baroka at FNB Stadium tomorrow (6pm), he's confident his technical team is doing its best to prepare for the match and get a good result. "We were relaxed even before the game [against Cape Town City]. As long as you are a player or as the technical team, doing everything in terms of being well-prepared and show the right attitude [throughout the week] to be well-prepared for Saturday, you can relax. You should be relaxed," Middendorp said. He added that the fact that Baroka are among the bottom teams does not mean Chiefs will take it easy against them. "I can tell you it's a very, very tough match if you are playing the so-called underdogs. "If we are not prepared to give 100% in each position, there's no chance for us to win this game," added the 60-year-old mentor. Chiefs are unbeaten in their last five league matches with two wins and three draws. Baroka, on the other hand, have suffered three consecutive defeats.
