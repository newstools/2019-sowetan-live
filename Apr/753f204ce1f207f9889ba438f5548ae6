Ex-Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba has revealed his disappointment at being fired via a text message by National First Division (NFD) strugglers Witbank Spurs. "I just saw an SMS saying they are firing me. They never had the decency of calling me. I am very disappointed. I expected them to be professional," he told Sowetan. Mashaba, pictured, was shown the door last week, having overseen nine games with four losses, three draws and only two victories. After sacking the former Bafana mentor, Spurs chairman Themba Mafu took over the coaching reins. The Siyavutha owner's first match in the dugout as a coach was a real baptism of fire, losing 5-0 to promotion-chasing Ajax Cape Town away last Saturday. Spurs are rooted at the bottom of the table on 21 points after 26 games. While confirming former Bafana midfielder Kagiso Dikgacoi has been roped in as assistant coach until the end of the season, Spurs chief executive Freddie Mapulane dismissed Mashaba's version that he was sacked via an SMS. "That's not true that we fired Mashaba via an SMS. We sat down, we had a meeting and we agreed that he must leave the club," said Mapulane. Mashaba was reluctant to say whether he would be challenge his dismissal.
