Some drastic measures need to be taken to curb the scourge of car accidents that are claiming the lives of our professional footballers, mostly occurring in wee hours of the morning, says concerned Highlands Park club director Sinky Mnisi who confirmed the postponement of his club’s Premiership fixture against Free State Stars, yesterday. Highlands were to host Ea Lla Koto at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday. But the football authorities on Tuesday postponed the match because Stars will be attending the funeral of Sinethemba Jantjie, who will be laid to rest at his home in the Eastern Cape. The 30-year-old player, who was due to join Bidvest Wits at the end of the season, was killed in a car accident in Bethlehem, Free State, on Monday morning. “I just hope that I will not be misunderstood, but clubs must do something about these occurrences. We are losing players to car crashes and these accidents happen in the early hours,” said Mnisi. He said the PSL showed the spirit of ubuntu by postponing their clash with Stars. “It is only fair that Stars and fans are afforded the opportunity to bury their player,” said Mnisi. Meanwhile, Jantjie’s memorial will take place at Bohlokong Hall, Bethlehem, today from 11am, with the funeral at Oxton village in Whittlesea on Saturday.
