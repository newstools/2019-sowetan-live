Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba has sent the MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun to Alexandra to “assess the situation”. Sun is expected to also address members of the media. This was confirmed in a press statement sent by his office on Wednesday morning. Addressing the #AlexTotalShutdown, Mashaba blamed the “previous administration” for the housing plight facing Alexandra residents. The township residents embarked on a total shutdown protest on Tuesday raising several concerns including the issue of shacks being erected without following proper procedures and being ignored by waste collection company Pikitup. Police had their hands full moving from one spot to another trying to defuse groups of protesters around the Alexandra township. “I deeply sympathise with the challenges experienced by the residents of Alex. For decades, the people of Alex have continually been let down by previous administrations in the provision of housing and addressing migration into the community, said Mashaba in a statement. “Indeed, during the local government elections of 2016, the ANC, province and the previous administration committed to providing investment into the area so as to address housing challenges and development in the area.” Mashaba said that this commitment was an empty promise as it was made without any strategy. The ANC was not immediately available to respond to Mashaba’s claims.
