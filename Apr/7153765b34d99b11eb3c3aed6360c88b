The South African Football Association (Safa) has noted the outcome of the ABC Motsepe League match between JDR FC and Vaal Professionals which ended 11-1 in favour of JDR and ordered a replay. The match took place at Isak Steyl Stadium, Vaal University of Technology, on March 30. In ordering a replay, Safa considered a number of factors including the log standings and the fact that the two teams did not submit any reports as prescribed by the Uniform Rules of the ABC Motsepe League and the reports of the match officials and the Safa provincial secretary. "The association has resolved that there are enough grounds to suspect foul play regarding the final result," Safa confirmed in the statement. "Therefore, Safa has issued a directive that the match must be replayed and that the earlier result is null and void." The two teams have been informed of this decision, with the date and venue of the replay to follow in due course. The association further noted that it has intensified its monitoring of the various leagues as they are about to conclude and in this regard, will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that fair play prevails at all times.
