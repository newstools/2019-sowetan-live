As they still have to face all the three main title favourites in Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits, Black Leopards' remaining games look tougher than any other team trying to stave off relegation. Leopards' daunting programme starts off tonight when they battle it out with log leaders Pirates at Orlando Stadium (7.30pm). To make matters worse, Lidoda Duvha still have a date with bottom-placed Maritzburg United, who have since shown they are capable of springing a surprise and beat the axe. After the Bucs game, Leopards host another Soweto giants, Kaizer Chiefs, on Saturday. Two weeks later, Lidoda Duvha will visit unpredictable Wits, before hosting Maritzburg three days later. Amakhosi may be practically out of the title race, but it's still a tricky assignment for the Venda-based side as the Glamour Boys aim to find their rhythm before the Nedbank Cup semifinal clash away to Chippa United on April 20. Nevertheless, Leopards goalkeeper King Ndlovu is optimistic of survival, pinning his hopes on winning their home matches. The shot-stopper sounded like they are targetting a draw tonight at Bucs. "I am confident we will win all our remaining home games. We are going there [to Orlando Stadium] with a mentality to win, but we also do not want to lose,'' Ndlovu told Sowetan yesterday. Leopards, who are placed 12th on the standings, are going to Bucs still licking their wounds after losing 3-1 to provincial foes Polokwane City on Sunday. Ndlovu admitted they did not come to the party against Rise and Shine. He hopes accumulating 32 points can save them. They are on 25 points, one away from the relegation zone. "We did not deserve to win on Sunday, but it's football."
