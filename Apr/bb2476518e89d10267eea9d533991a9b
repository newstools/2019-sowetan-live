A 22-year-old woman was arrested after she allegedly stabbed and killed a man in the farming town Bothaville, Free State, police said on Tuesday.

Thakeng said the 23-year-old man had been bleeding "profusely" and had a stab wound to his neck. He said preliminary investigation led the station commander to a house in Kgotsong where they found a woman who was believed to be responsible for the brutal act. "The murder weapon was found on the bed's head board and seized (by police)," he said. She was charged with murder and is expected to appear in the Bothaville Magistrate's Court soon.
