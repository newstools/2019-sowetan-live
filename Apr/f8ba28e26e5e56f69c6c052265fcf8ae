The Department of Correctional Services has denied social media reports that Dros restaurant rape accused Nicholas Ninow had been admitted to hospital due to an overdose. On Monday, civil rights movement #NotInMyName alleged that Ninow had been admitted in hospital after injecting himself with drugs. “The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) has noted with dismay a statement from #NotInMyName organisation, alleging that Nicholas Ninow overdosed on drugs. Sadly, DCS was never asked nor engaged by the #NotInMyName on the circumstances which may have led to Mr Ninow being treated by medical professionals,” said department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. He added: “Nicholas Ninow reported at our health care facility (in person) for medical attention and was examined by DCS health care professionals who then recommended that he be transferred to an external medical centre for further examination.” Nxumalo said Ninow’s health was stable and he was waiting to be discharge to a correctional services facility. Ninow, 20, has been in custody since September last year, following his arrest for allegedly raping a seven-year-old-girl in a Dros restaurant. He faces charges of rape‚ possession of drugs‚ intimidation and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. His lawyers told the court that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in January 2013, and that he had undergone treatment for substance abuse as a teenager. But in February, the High Court in Pretoria declared him fit to stand trial after a month-long psychiatric evaluation at Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital. He is expected back in court later this year.
