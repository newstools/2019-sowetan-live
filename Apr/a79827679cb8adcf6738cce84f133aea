The husband of environmental affairs minister Nomvula Mokonyane, Serge, died on Thursday morning in Johannesburg. “It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Mr Serge Mokonyane, husband to Minister of Environmental Affairs, Nomvula Mokonyane, at a Johannesburg hospital this morning,” Mokonyane’s spokesperson Mlimandlela Ndamase said in a brief statement. Serge was hospitalised last month. The statement did not say what the cause of death was. “The minister and family are officially in mourning and humbly request privacy at this moment of grief. The family will in due course communicate details pertaining to the funeral and any other memorial events and services.” The presidency said Serge died following “an extended illness”. “President Ramaphosa’s thoughts and prayers are with Minister Mokonyane, her immediate and extended family, and friends and associates of Mr Mokonyane.”
