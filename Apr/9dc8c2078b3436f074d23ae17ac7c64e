Black Leopards coach Dylan Kerr says his team owe it to their fans to register a famous victory over Kaizer Chiefs. Lidoda Duvha suffered their 11th loss of the season after a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Orlando Pirates in midweek. Leopards arguably have the most difficult fixture list to end the season as they play all the title contenders. They next take on Kaizer Chiefs at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (3pm). Kerr has urged his players to pull off a famous win against the Soweto heavyweights. "The game against Chiefs is now even bigger after the loss to Pirates," Kerr said. "So, we going to have to get the right starting XI that can go and get three points against Chiefs. Especially after the past two results, we owe it to our supporters who have been coming to all our games." Leopards are 12th in the Absa Premiership standings with 25 points from 24 games - only a point above Free State Stars, off the relegation zone. In the last five games, the club from Venda have one win, two losses and two draws. The 52-year-old tactician believes their form has been negatively affected by sporadic breaks. "The Afcon and Nedbank Cup breaks haven't done us any favours. The players told me they missed playing games because we can't train every day but not play." Despite the challenges, the Englishman has vowed not to alter the way his team plays. "I am not going to change how we play because it works. I do my work on my own. I have got an assistant and a goalkeeper coach," he added. "I don't have what all the big teams have. Even Highlands Park have more than what we have got." Chiefs defenders Daniel Cardoso, Kgotso Moleko and Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya will all have to tread carefully as they are a yellow card away from a one-match ban, with a Ke Yona cup semifinal against Chippa United next weekend.
