The game between struggling Jomo Cosmos and leaders Stellenbosch at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday is arguably the National First Division's (NFD's) biggest drawcard this weekend. With Stellenbosch looking to stretch their lead at the summit, while Cosmos are fighting to ensure safety, this match promises to be a thriller. The Stellies top the table with 48 points, 17 ahead of 13th-placed Ezenkosi. The former top-flight club is just five points away from the relegation zone. However, Cosmos midfielder Inky Masuku cannot imagine Ezenkosi campaigning in the ABC Motsepe League next season. The lad from Nelspruit in Mpumalanga is of the sentiment that beating Stellenbosch will be the turning point in their bid to move up the table and beat the axe. "We are faced with a tricky situation . it feels strange for us to be where we are. But we are not going to Motsepe League. Look, Cosmos is a big team, we can find our way back to the top,'' Masuku told Sowetan yesterday. "Stellenbosch are one of the most organised teams in the NFD, beating such a team will turn the tables for us. I think if we can get this win, everything will fall into place for us." The former Mbombela United workhorse has bemoaned luck for their dire situation as they've just amassed seven wins and seven draws, with 11 defeats this term. "We do everything well, playing good football but luck is not on our side . that has been our main problem. Even the coach [Jomo Sono] has alluded that we are playing well but it's just that we are not winning, it's frustrating."
