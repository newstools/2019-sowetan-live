Basanti Bhoi was stunned when she saw a large cobra swallowing a smaller cobra at her home in Naranagada, in eastern India, on Tuesday. According to Daily Mail, a snake handler was called to remove the cobra. Local villagers were astounded when he grabbed the snake by the tail and the smaller snake started to come out of the cobra's mouth. According to experts, cannibalism is common in cobras. Snakes are known to regurgitate their prey when they feel threatened. This allows them to make a quick escape. After being captured, the cobra was released into its natural habitat.
