Two people are expected to apply for bail  after they were arrested on charges of fraud in connection with the hoax resurrection performed by pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia Ministries International. Nkululeko Dlamini and Silungisani Sibanda (also known as Grace Ncube) are facing three counts of fraud.  They were due to appear in the Johannesburg magistrate’s court on Wednesday. The pair were arrested on Tuesday and charged with fraud after allegedly partaking in the false resurrection of Brighton Moyo in February. Moyo allegedly fled to his home country of Zimbabwe after coming under fire and being hounded by the media after the hoax. He was reported to have died of pneumonia this week. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that two people were arrested on fraud charges in connection with the alleged resurrection. "They are in custody. They will be appearing in the Johannesburg magistrate's court [soon] to apply for bail," she said. Police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said in March that SAPS was investigating three cases of fraud opened in connection with the "resurrection" incident. "One case was opened by a funeral parlour based here in Gauteng, another case was opened by people who said they were concerned citizens, and a third one was opened by pastor Mboro [Paseka Motsoeneng]," said Masondo.
