Mamelodi Sundowns have not allowed Al  Ahly ’s tricks to destabilise their preparations. Downs held their first training session last night after the venue of their clash against the Egyptians was moved from Suez. The Brazilians arrived in Egypt on Tuesday, and are staying at the Raddisson Blu Hotel in Alexandria. Al Ahly  attempted to throw Sundowns off after their CAF Champions League quarterfinal second leg was moved from the Egyptian Army Stadium in Suez to the Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria. The eight-time Champions League winners will be hoping that Sundowns crumble in front of a sea of red at the 86 000 capacity Borg El Arab. The 2016 African kings have one foot in the semifinals after they thrashed the Red Devils 5-0 in the first leg in Pretoria. Goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene said the team has settled down and they are focused on the second leg on Saturday (6pm). “Things are going fine so far here in Alexandria. It’s a bit chilly but so far so good,” Mweene told Sowetan from their camp. “We checked in at the hotel and no, there have been no funny business from the Egyptians. “Even if they came with tricks we are experienced now and have played North African teams before, so we knew what to expect.” Downs management have not spared any costs in ensuring that the team hold their own in the second leg. After having initially secured a hotel and training facility in Suez, they were forced to cancel their bookings where they suffered astronomical losses. Sundowns acting general manager Yogesh Singh said management has done everything possible for the team to perform well at the weekend. “We expected that they would come with some tricks. Nevertheless we have found a new hotel and training facility in Alexandria,” he said. “We take care of everything to ensure the players and the technical team only have to worry about the game.”
