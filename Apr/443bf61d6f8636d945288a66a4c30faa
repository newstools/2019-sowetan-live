The lowest daytime temperatures of the year so far are bringing autumn chill to Gauteng on Tuesday. Gauteng Weather says the crisp air is pushing in from a cold front that brushed extreme southern and eastern South Africa. Johannesburg's maximum is 22 degrees while Pretoria is registering 24Â° Celcius. The SA Weather Service says there is a probability of heavy rain and possible flooding in parts of the province. It also issued a warning for the Free State, saying severe thunderstorms are observed north-east of Ventersburg moving east-north-east towards Steynsrus and Arlington, with possible strong winds, heavy downpours and hail. This follows welcome rainfall in various parts of the country on Monday. The Vaal Dam, which supplies Gauteng, had slipped from being full a year ago to under 70% this week.
