Forget ATM bombing - a video byÂ Sky News shows two men robbing an ATM in less than five minutes using a digger. The incident happened in Londonderry, Ireland, and has raised questions about why no action was taken quicker. According to Sky News, this incident was one of many that have happened in the area recently. The video shows a digger making its way to the bank's premises before the cash dispenser is ripped out of the building. The gang seemed to be composed of three men wearing balaclavas. One is seen operating the digger as he loads the cash dispenser into a hole cut in the roof of a waiting SUV car, while the others start the car before they make off with the cash, leaving the digger behind.
