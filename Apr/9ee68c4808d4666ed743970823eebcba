A West African referee has been picked to handle the Caf Champions League quarterfinal first leg clash between hosts Mamelodi Sundowns and Al Ahly at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (kickoff 3pm). Senegalese official Maguette N’Diaye will be the man in the middle as the Brazilians take on the Egyptians‚ who are the eight-time winners of the competition. According to Caf‚ Maguette N’Diaye will be assisted by Cameroonian Elvis Guy Noupue Nguegoue and Seydou Tiama‚ who hails from Burkina Faso. The 32-year-old N’Diaye has been a Fifa international referee for the past few years. He officiated in five matches during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and issued 15 yellow cards‚ including five in the match between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia played in Kinshasa last month. One of Africa’s top match officials‚ Bakary Papa Gassama of Gambia‚ will be the referee for the return leg in Egypt next week.
