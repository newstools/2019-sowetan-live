Cyclone Kenneth hit the east coastal island of Comoros on Thursday killing three people. Winds on the island reached up to 140/km, Reuters reported. Schools and government offices were closed on Thursday. On Wednesday the country's officials said about 680,000 people were at risk of being affected by the cyclone in Mozambique. The cyclone hit Mozambique on Thursday with winds up to 220/km. About 30,000 people have been evacuated from vulnerable areas. The National Institute of Disaster Management said that it had enough supplies to help 140,000 people for about two weeks, Reuters reported.
