ANC secretary general Ace Magashule has called to order party supporters who disrupted the launch of journalist Pieter-Louis Myburgh's book‚ Gangster State. This comes after a group of Magashule loyalists stormed the event at Exclusive Books in Sandton on Tuesday evening‚ reportedly tearing up copies of the book. A group of supporters in Mangaung have also scheduled a public ceremony to burn copies of the book on Monday next week. In a statement on Wednesday‚ Magashule said the contents of the book - which implicates him in rampant corruption while he was Free State premier - should rather be engaged "in the battle of ideas". "The Constitution and laws of the country allow for channels to follow when we disagree with information and ideas‚ whether in books or the media. I have indicated to my organisation that I am pursuing legal action against the false allegations made in the book‚" he said. "In addition‚ where we disagree with views expressed in books‚ the media and other platforms‚ we must use peaceful and constitutional means to engage those who peddle lies and fake news. “Those purporting to be ANC members and supporters disrupting book launches‚ (threatening to) burn books and intimidate authors and journalists in my name‚ or to be revolutionary should desist‚ because these are actions of political intolerance‚ and against freedom of expression for all South Africans."
