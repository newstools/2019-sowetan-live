A man was left critically injured in the early hours of Friday outside the M-Caf√© club in Vanderbijlpark after an apparent bar fight in which at least a dozen vehicles were damaged. ER24 said a man was assaulted outside the restaurant on Hendrik Van Eck Road. "ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene after 2.20am to find the local authorities already in attendance. Two petrol attendants were found treating a patient lying on the pavement," said ER 24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. He said paramedics assessed the man, believed to be in his 30s, and found that he had numerous injuries that had left him in a critical condition. According to reports, men were throwing bricks at each other. "The man was treated for his injuries and provided with several advanced life support interventions before he was transported to a nearby hospital. "Two other men were assessed on the scene and found to have minor injuries. Both men refused treatment and were later handed over to local authorities. "Thirteen light motor vehicles were damaged in this incident," Meiring said. Police did not have any more information immediately available when approached for comment. News24 reported that three men arrived at the club and a scuffle ensued. "The men were then thrown out of the establishment, where the fighting continued," the website said.
