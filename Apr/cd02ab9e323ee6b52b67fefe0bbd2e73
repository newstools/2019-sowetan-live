Maritzburg United striker Mohau Mokate believes accumulating 12 points from their remaining six matches will be enough for the Team of Choice to survive relegation. Hosting an unpredictable Bloemfontein Celtic side at Harry Gwala Stadium tonight (8pm), Mokate has also identified Phunya Sele Sele's weakness, indicating the Free Staters boast a sluggish defence. "To me, I think 12 points out of [a possible] 18 will save us [from being relegated]. Every game we play now is a cup final,'' said Mokate, who has just netted twice in 19 league outings so far this term. "Their weakness is at the back, they are a bit slow. If we can put that speed upfront we will manage to hurt them. We also need to close them down in the middle of the park because that's where they can be dangerous, especially with combination plays.'' Having managed to score just 14 goals in 24 league matches, Maritzburg are the lowest-scoring side. This is the main reason they are languishing at the bottom of the log with a mere 17 points. "As strikers, we haven't been scoring. to be honest. But now it's do or die. We are doing it [scoring] every day at training, now it's about time we showed it in the games,'' Mokate admitted and promised to rectify their goal-scoring woes.
