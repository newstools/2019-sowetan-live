The Judicial Service Commission has shed light on why it decided to halt the interviews of the six people vying for the two vacant Constitutional Court positions. The interviews had been scheduled to take place on Monday, but after deliberations behind closed doors it was decided that they would be put on hold. “At its sitting, the JSC took a decision to postpone the interviews for the candidates nominated for the constitutional vacancies to Wednesday April 3 2019 due to a potential conflict of interest involving the president of the Supreme Court of Appeal,” the JSC said in a statement. President Mandisa Maya was one of the panelists who was to be part of the interviews. The commission did not elaborate further on the conflict of interest. The six candidates are high court judge Annali Basson, deputy judge president of the Western Cape division of the high court Patricia Goliath,  judge Jody Kollapen of the Gauteng High Court, judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane, also from the high court, judge Stevan Madjiet of the Supreme Court of Appeal and judge Zukisa Tshiqi, also of the SCA.
