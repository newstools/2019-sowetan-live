Algeria's parliament appointed on Tuesday its upper house chairman Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president following the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika after weeks of mass protests against his rule. Protesters, who are demanding sweeping democratic reforms, are opposed to figures like Bensalah, a close associate of Bouteflika and his inner circle who dominated Algeria for decades. Upon stepping down last week, Bouteflika promised that elections would be held after 90 days as part of a transition he said would usher in a new era. As per the Algerian constitution, Bensalah will remain interim president until new elections are held. "We must work to allow the Algerian people elect their president as soon as possible," Bensalah told parliament
