Truth be told, Jamaica is not a typical football nation, let alone in women's football. However, according to Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis, Jamaica, mainly known for producing world-class sprinters such as Usain Bolt, can pose a real threat when these two Fifa World Cup debutants battle it out in a friendly at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Sunday (3pm). "Look, they've qualified for the World Cup. They've just beaten Chile [1-0 and 3-2 in friendlies last month], who we played before and did not get the result [referring to Banyana's 2-1 loss and 2-2 draw in friendlies in October last year], so surely they've improved as a team,'' Ellis cautioned. "It's a different [opponent]. maybe to Netherlands and Sweden, it's a different team and you need different kind of teams to play against to prepare for future games because you do not know what you will come up against." The match against the Caribbean nation will be Banyana's last on home soil before the World Cup, from June 7 to July 7 in France. Ellis has highlighted the importance of winning this farewell match. "It's important that we put in a very good showing and get a positive result. the fans will get happy and that will also boost us with confidence and momentum going forward,'' said the Banyana mentor. In the World Cup, SA are drawn in Group B alongside China, Germany and Spain, opening their campaign against Spain on the second day of the competition. To intensify their preparations, Banyana will also face the US on May 12. Positioned four places below the 49th-ranked Banyana Banyana in the Fifa rankings, The Reggae Girls, as the Jamaican senior women's national team is known, will face Brazil, Australia and Italy in Group C in France.
