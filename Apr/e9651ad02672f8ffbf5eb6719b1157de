A six-month old baby who was stolen from his mother while at the Mokopane Shopping Centre two weeks ago has been found unharmed, Limpopo police said on Sunday. The infant was found at the Ga-Mphela village near Polokwane on Saturday, said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "During this operation, the alleged child snatcher, a 17-year-old woman, and her 23-year-old boyfriend were nabbed. The kidnapped baby was found in their possession unharmed," Ngoepe said. The mother of the child had since positively identified the child. The 24-year-old woman had told police that she had met the woman who stole her child while walking in the mall. "The suspect offered to hold the baby so that the mother could eat. Later, they went to another supermarket [together] while the suspect was still carrying the baby. Without the mother noticing, the suspect disappeared with the infant," said Ngoepe. The two suspects were expected to appear in the Mokopane Magistrateâ€™s Court on Monday on a kidnapping charge.
