Afrikaans musician Kurt Darren's attempt to sing the national anthem at the Varsity Cup on Monday night has left a bitter taste in many people's mouths as footage from the event was put on social media platforms. Maties faced off against Tuks at the Danie Craven stadium in Stellenbosch on Monday night for the final. Maties won the Varsity Cup 34-12. But instead of the power of Maties being celebrated, it was Kurt's national anthem that dominated talk.
