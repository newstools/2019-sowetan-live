The case against a Durban woman accused of dumping her newborn baby down a stormwater drain is set to resume at the Ntuzuma Magistrateâ€™s Court on Monday. The 32-year-old, who may not be photographed or filmed due to the sensitive nature of the case, has been charged with attempted murder following the dramatic four-hour rescue of her baby in February. She was arrested a week after the baby, named "Sibanisethu" (Our ray of hope) by the Newlands East community, made international headlines when she was plucked from a drain in Newlands East by paramedics. The woman was previously granted bail of R5,000.
