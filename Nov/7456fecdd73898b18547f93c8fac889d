The Sunday Times Lifestyle sex survey is back! For the third year in a row, our sex survey is set to provide a fascinating glimpse into what South Africans get up to in the sack ... on the kitchen table, in the loos at their local clubs, or at their annual office parties. Once again, we’ve teamed up with the crafty people at Ratepop to create a short, insightful  — and really fun — survey. It includes a range of questions about who you’re sleeping with, what your sex life is like, and what you'd love it to be like — all answered anonymously, of course. Simply CLICK HERE TO TAKE THE SURVEY via Facebook Messenger, read our privacy policy and click the “get started” button. (Took the survey last year? Click here, then click the menu in Facebook Messenger, select "options" and then "restart survey" to get started.) We give you our every assurance that YOUR IDENTITY WILL BE KEPT COMPLETELY SECRET. Only your answers will be used to compile the results of the survey — so take the opportunity to be totally honest. The results will be published in the Sunday Times Lifestyle magazine on Sunday December 8 2019. Look out for this issue because you won't want to miss the chance to find out what moves South Africans from gentle sighs to joyful yells of pleasure when they're behind closed bedroom doors.
