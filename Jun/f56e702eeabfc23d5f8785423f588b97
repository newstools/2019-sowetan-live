Sudan's chief prosecutor said on Saturday that ousted president Omar al-Bashir will be referred for trial soon after a period for objections expires. Alwaleed Sayed Ahmed Mahmoud also told a news conference in Khartoum that criminal cases related to corruption have been opened against 41 other former officials. He said he had attended a meeting with military heads to discuss judicial supervision of a plan to clear what he called "criminals" from an area adjacent to a protest camp in the centre of the capital. But the idea of dispersing the protesters was not discussed, he said.
