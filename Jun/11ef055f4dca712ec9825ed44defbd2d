A Russian passenger plane overshot the runway, crashed into a building and caught fire at an airport in Siberia on Thursday, killing two crew members, officials said. The small An-24 aircraft, travelling from Ulan-Ude in Siberia, was attempting an emergency landing at Nizhneangarsk airport, the regional government of Buryatia said. But the plane went 100 metres off the tarmac and "crashed into a waste treatment facility building". "The plane caught fire," it said on its official Instagram account. Two crew members were killed and 43 passengers, including a child, survived. Investigators launched a probe into possible violation of air safety regulations, the transport investigators of Eastern Siberia said in a statement. The plane belonged to regional Angara airline and was on a regular flight.
