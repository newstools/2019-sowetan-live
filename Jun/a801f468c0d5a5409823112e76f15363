Two Limpopo traffic officers were robbed on Friday afternoon after pulling over a car for speeding. Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the officers, who were conducting speed trap duties along the Slaagboom road outside Groblersdal, stopped a grey VW Polo TSI without number plates with five occupants for exceeding the speed limit. “While they were busy issuing the driver with a written notice, three passengers alighted, two of them armed with rifles and the other one with a pistol. They robbed both the officers and took two cellphones, a firearm, and the equipment before they fled the scene. “The suspects are unknown and no arrest has been made and the investigation is continuing,” Ngoepe said. He further added that a multi-disciplinary task team had been established to hunt down the suspects.
