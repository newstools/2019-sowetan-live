The main campus of the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) in Pretoria hosted the fourth week of the Safa Women's National League where two Gauteng-based teams won big on the day. Mamelodi Sundowns opened Sunday's action with a 3-0 victory over the University of Western Cape, while the University of Johannesburg won their second match of the league  when they beat Richmond Ladies by the same margin in the second fixture of the day. Hosts TUT Ladies had to dig deep against Bloemfontein Celtic  in what was a very tough, exhilarating and mouthwatering encounter. The students seemed to be inspired by their home crowd and came back from a goal down to settle for a 1-all draw after a pulsating 90 minutes of action. The first goal of the encounter came when goalkeeper Kebotseng Moletsane made a blunder from a back pass and gave Celtic the lead from an own goal in the second half. TUT captain Hildah Magaia scored a contender for goal of the season just seconds before the end of the match for the two teams to share the spoils - a crucial point which still keeps them second on the log, while Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies are third on the table.
