SuperSport United goalkeeper Ronwen Williams wants to remain at Matsatsantsa beyond his playing days, hoping for a job within the club post retirement. "SuperSport is a family-orientated team; they look after players even after football. You look at Jabu Pule [Mahlangu], Thabo September and Ricardo Katza. We look after our players, that's the reason I am happy at this team," said Williams. "My wish is to stay with SuperSport even after retirement. Look at the coach [Kaitano Tembo], I mean, he's been with the team for 20 years. He was the captain and now he's lifting his first cup [the MTN8] as a coach. I hope I will also be given a job within the team." SuperSport were crowned MTN8 champions, for the second time in three years, after their 1-0 win over Highlands Park in the final at Orlando Stadium at  the weekend. Williams attributed their Wafa Wafa success to camaraderie, among other aspects. The Matsatsantsa shot-stopper was also thrilled at seeing their technical team, especially, Tembo, as the MTN8 was his maiden silverware as a coach, thriving. "[Tembo] is part of this team's history, he's been here for 20 years. Our technical team as well, Andre Arendse [goalkeeper coach] played here before, coach Nico Labohm  [Tembo's assistant] coached the development. he actually coached me from the development, so we are family-orientated," said Williams. "Coach Tembo is very good, the way that he deals with us, players, especially the older guys. If he sees that we've got a lot of game we'd give us extended breaks and things like that. So, we are happy to have him, it's his first cup and he deserves it; it's special." SportsLIVE PODCAST SPECIAL: "Mark Alexander must step down" over Etzebeth - Claassen For more episodes, click here.
