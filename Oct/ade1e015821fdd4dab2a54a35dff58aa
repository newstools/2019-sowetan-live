They will play in their first final since 2007 when they meet England next weekend at this stadium. In a nerve jangling semi-final dominated by high kicks and very little attacking play the teams were deadlocked at 9-all before Damian de Allende touched down for the Boks. Handre Pollard added the conversion but Wales scored a converted try in the 65th minute to level matters. Pollard however showed nerves of steel by slotting the winning penalty four minutes from full time. South Africa (9) 19 Try: Damian de Allende. Conversion: Handre Pollard. Penalties: Pollard (3) Wales (6) 16 Try: Josh Adams. Conversion: Leigh Halfpenny. Penalties: Dan Biggar (3).
