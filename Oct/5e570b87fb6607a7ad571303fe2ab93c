Across the world, entrepreneurship is acknowledged as a driver for economic growth. In July 2018, the Small Business Institute reported that SA has about 250,000 formal small-, medium- and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs). The institute also reported that these make up 98.5% of the economy but provide only 28% of the jobs. To change this, effort needs to be put into ensuring growth. This means equipping small businesses, especially those owned by previously disadvantaged individuals, with the skills, know-how and means to conduct business successfully. Join the Eskom Development Foundation Business Investment Competition at a Sowetan Dialogue in a discussion on what needs to be done to turn SAâ€™s economy around, through the success of small business.
