He said police received information that a child's leg had been "severed by two men". "They immediately rushed to the scene and found the boyâ€™s severed leg. The community members then proceeded to the place where the alleged suspects reside and set alight two huts," said Hlathi. Hlathi said cases of attempted murder and arson had been opened but no  arrests had been made yet. People with information related to the incident  were urged to contact police. Following the incident,  provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Mondli Zuma warned community members against taking the law into their own hands.
