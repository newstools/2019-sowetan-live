Convicted Dros rapist Nicholas Ninow dominated Twitter  during sentencing proceedings on Wednesday, with many weighing in on his testimony. Ninow admitted to having intentionally raped the seven-year-old girl at a  Dros restaurant in Pretoria in September last year. He said that during the incident he was in a dark place in his life and that he felt no emotion about what he had done. The court heard from psychologist Marina Genis, who said Ninow had a “chaotic” childhood during which he suffered abuse and neglect. She said Ninow could be rehabilitated if he adhered to psychiatric treatments. Ninow recited a poem to his victim and apologised for his actions. The testimony drew mixed reaction, with many saying the case was an example of “white privilege”. Here're some of  the reactions: LISTEN | Dros rapist sentenced to life imprisonment
