Many of us have looked to Rihanna for fashion inspiration and tips on how to be a boss babe. Now our favourite bad girl is giving us a chance to literally take a leaf out of  her book, as the fashion and beauty icon announced the release of her visual autobiography which features over 1000 images. According to Rolling Stone,  the book has been released in collaboration with global publishing house, Phaidon. The book, simply called Rihanna, is reportedly a whooping 504 pages  of some never-before seen  images that chronicle  the tale of the Work singer’s life; from her humble beginnings in Barbados to her worldwide tours and much-loved sartorial choices. Sharing the good news with her fans on social media, Rihanna wrote: “Happy to finally share this collection of incredible memories.” The book also comes in  three limited editions, one which   comes with a custom-sculpted marble pedestal which is reportedly  already sold out. At Rihanna’s Diamond Ball last month, long-time Riri stan, Cardi B reportedly bid $111,000 on the Ultra Luxury Supreme edition, including its 2,000-pound marble pedestal and became one of 10 people in the world to own it. For those who aren't one of the ten people in the globe who own the Ultra Luxury Supreme edition, the Luxury Supreme issue goes for $5 500 (about R82 000) while the cheapest of the three, the standard Rihanna book retails for $150 (about R2 200).
