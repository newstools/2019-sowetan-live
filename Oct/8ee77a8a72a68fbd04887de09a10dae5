The Gauteng department of health has suspended 18 staff members over a period of three months for a range of issues including sexual harassment and compromising patient care. In a written reply to DA MPL Jack Bloom, Gauteng health MEC Bandile Masuku said the suspension periods ranged from the least on 24 days and the most on 111 days. “These staff members were suspended on different issues that include abuse of sick leave, absenteeism, gross insubordination, dereliction of duty, prejudicing the administration and efficiency of the department,” Masuku said. Masuku said those who had been suspended include junior administration staff, health professionals, property caretaker and senior managers, with the lowest annual salary paid being R128,193 and the highest being R1.4m. “[The] Majority of the suspended officials have investigations under way. The intended time frame to conclude the cases of suspension is within 60 days but due to the complexity of acts of misconducts and other identified inefficiencies, other cases go beyond [that time],” Masuku said. To speed up the disciplinary cases, the department plans to develop partnerships with the district in ensuring speedy resolution of cases. “There will be continuous training and development of labour relations practitioners. Currently 22 practitioners are attending a dispute resolution course commonly known as a commissioner’s course,” Masuku said.
