According to a study by the SA Journal of Human Resources in 2012, 31.1% of employees have reported to being bullied in the workplace. While many might view workplace bullying as another day at the office this might not be the case for some. We speak to Clinical Psychologist, Sikander Kalla about how one can best identify if they are being bullied by a senior in the work place without losing their job.
