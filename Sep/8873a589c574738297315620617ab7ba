The casualty department at Africa's biggest hospital treated enough people last year to fill FNB stadium to near capacity. Shocking statistics tell a tale of how staff at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital dealt with violence and trauma as casualty staff treated a total of 84,846 patients in 2018. That's a staggering average of 7,000 per month. DA MPL Jack Bloom likened the numbers to a “war zone” when he received the statistics from Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in response to a question posed in the provincial legislature. The breakdown of incidents is as follows: Of those, 22,238 were directly related to violence and road accidents: There were also 3,597 psychiatric cases, 1,298 cases of organophosphate poisoning, and 45 suicides by hanging. Most categories registered a year-on-year increase except for assault cases, which offered a faint glimmer of respite by dropping by several hundred.
