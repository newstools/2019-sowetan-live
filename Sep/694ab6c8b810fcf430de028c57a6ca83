They do not have the registration number of the vehicle driven by the kidnap suspects. “We are calling on anyone with any information to contact the police,” Makhubele said. The school has also issued an alert, calling on people to assist with the search. Amy-Lee, a Grade R pupil, is wearing a pink dress, white shirt and black stockings.
