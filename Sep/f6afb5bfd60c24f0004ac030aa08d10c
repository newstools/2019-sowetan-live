At his maiden press conference as the new permanent Bafana Bafana coach, Molefi Ntseki tried his best to articulate that he will do things differently from his predecessors, and that he is the right man for the job. The former under-17 national team coach was confirmed as the new Bafana Bafana coach on Saturday after a meeting of the Safa national executive committee. The 50-year-old worked under previous coaches Shakes Mashaba and Stuart Baxter. In his vision for the future, Ntseki outlined plans to have a selection committee responsible for choosing the squad and a scouting team; he also roped in Trott Moloto to act as an adviser. "The selection committee can be my technical team because all that is important is the profiling of players. We should not be scratching our heads when we are about to announce the team. "It won't be difficult to get a few heads together to select the team. It's not going to be a big committee where we end up having too many disagreements," Ntseki said. "In the 21 years that I have been coaching, you learn over time because you come across different types of players. "I started in 1998 and didn't have any qualifications. But since then I have gained a lot of experience to enable me to take this job." Ntseki has had little time to celebrate after he got the call this past Saturday that he got the job. "When I got the call I smiled but reality crept in ... that now I am in charge and need to go out there and do my best." His first game is a friendly away to Zambia on Saturday.
