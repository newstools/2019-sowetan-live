"As a club our target every season is to try to have something to show for our efforts by winning silverware," said United coach Kaitano Tembo. "We are a very ambitious club and we always want to try to compete irrespective of our circumstances. "A lot of preparation goes into the team and that is probably why we are always there fighting for cups because we work very hard." Tembo is looking for his maiden title as a coach in his second year since taking over the reins. In his rookie season, the Zimbabwean boss guided the team to the final of this competition, but they lost to Benni McCarthy's Citizens in a penalty shootout. With the final coming in two weeks' time, their immediate focus is now on their next league match against Polokwane City at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (3pm). "We are happy to be in the final but our focus now turns to the game against Polokwane. The time will come for us to prepare for Highlands."
