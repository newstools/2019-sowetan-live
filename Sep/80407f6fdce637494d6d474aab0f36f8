A 42-year-old man arrested in connection with the disappearance of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana faced charges of rape, murder and defeating the ends of justice on Monday. Mrwetyana disappeared more than a week ago and three private investigators joined police in an extensive search for the first-year film and media student, along with distraught friends and fellow students. Shocked friends attending the trial at the Wynberg magistrateâ€™s court discovered that the suspect, who cannot be named as he must still attend an identity parade, was an employee at a post office - one of the places she was last seen alive. The state alleged that the man had bludgeoned Mrwetyana with a scale inside the post office. She had allegedly fought back but was knocked unconscious. He later allegedly later made a confession and indicated where a body was buried. During court proceedings, the suspect turned around to face the crowd and grinned slightly. People in the public gallery called him a "pig". The case was postponed to November 5. This is a developing story.
