In-form SuperSport United midfielder Sipho Mbule has vowed to keep level-headed amid his meteoric rise. Since the start of the season, Mbule has been trending, with many awed by his flair and quick feet that have played a pivotal role in Matsatsantsa's promising start to the campaign. Mbule, 21, is eager to put in another solid shift when they face Mamelodi Sundowns in the second leg of the MTN8 semifinal at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (7.30pm). "I don't want to get carried away. There's still a long way to go in my career, so I think what's important is just to keep on working hard and stay concentrated," Mbule said. "I am a person who takes it one step at a time, so my focus now is on the MTN8 semifinals against Sundowns. I am positive that we can win this match and go to the final. Last season we lost in the final [to Cape Town City], so we'd want to make up for that and win the MTN8 this time around." In the wake of the first leg of the Wafa Wafa semifinals three weeks ago, SuperSport mentor Kaitano Tembo had challenged Mbule to be more effective. Interestingly, in the following fixture (last week's 3-3 stalemate against City), the SA under-23 ace grabbed his maiden league goal. "The coach always tells me to be more influential ... goals and assists is what you are judged on when you are playing in an offensive position. "So I am really happy that I have scored my first league goal. I hope it's the start of great things," said Mbule.
