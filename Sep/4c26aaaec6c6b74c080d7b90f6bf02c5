Just months after nearly shutting down the internet with his matric farewell proposal, Nhlanhla and TK Nciza's son, Nkule, caused flames when he rocked up at the event in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a designer suit and Louis V shoes. Nkule is living his best life and his mama posted a string of videos of him looking like a king before the event. Nkule also gave us a glimpse of his gorgeous date, who was wearing a beautiful orange summer dress and gold heels. The young G got tweeps in their feels earlier this year when a video of him asking his date to the dance was shared online. In the video, Nkule can be seen preparing for the proposal, then jumping into a white Mercedes-Benz with flowers in his hands. As he approaches the school, he hangs out the sunroof and is surrounded by screaming students.
