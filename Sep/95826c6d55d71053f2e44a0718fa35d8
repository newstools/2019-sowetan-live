MTN8 ambassadors Jabu Mahlangu and Josta Dladla paid a visit to the Tiso Blackstar offices ahead of Tuesday and Wednesday’s second legs of that competition’s semifinals. Of course Mahlangu, who turned out for SuperSport United and is a brand ambassador for the Pretoria club, and Dladla, a former Mamelodi Sundowns star, could not agree on the result of Wednesday’s semifinal second leg Tswhane derby. The former stars – who both also turned out for Kaizer Chiefs – had us in hysterics with their banter on who will win the delicately-poised second leg between Matsatsantsa and the Brazilians at Lucas Moripe Stadium. The semifinal hangs in the balance after the first leg, also at Lucas Moripe, but on that occasion a home match for SuperSport and away game for Sundowns, was drawn 1-1.
