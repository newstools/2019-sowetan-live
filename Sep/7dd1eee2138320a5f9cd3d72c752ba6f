Spring has sprung and so have the latest trends and collections. While the options for what to wear this season are limitless, some of us are a little confused about how to incorporate the latest trends to our wardrobes. The confusion is now a thing of the past as Head of Designs at Witchery, Gavin Gage shares some tips on what to wear, how to wear it and staple pieces you must own. “For me the big message is colour. From summer spice tones to beautiful brights in Magenta Pink and Orange. The consistent message is around being optimistic and colour is such an optimistic element we can all participate in. Outfitting head-to-toe tones is impactful and I think our South African customer will love this, whilst mixing orange and Magenta in outfitting is very new and adds a real fashion edge to outfits.” “Separates dressing is particularly important this season and outfitting with knitted tanks and skirts is a personal favourite. I love skirts right now and for me they are one of the most important messages of the season. Printed and plain, in a variety of lengths, they are feeling incredibly modern.” Knit tanks with skirts. They are so important from a trends perspective whilst will transcend seasons to come.
