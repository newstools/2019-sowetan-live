Former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli will have to wait another month to know how long he will have to spend in jail in charges related to kidnapping and assault. Mdluli and his co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi appeared briefly in the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg on Thursday for sentencing proceedings. On July 30, Mdluli and Mthunzi were found guilty of charges relating to the 1999 kidnapping and assault of Oupa Ramogibe. Ramogibe was married to Mdluli's former lover Tshidi Buthelezi. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng postponed their matter in order for the state to finalise a correctional supervision report and a pre-sentencing report. He postponed the matter to November 7 and 8. Mokgoatlheng found Mdluli guilty of four counts of intimidation, two counts of kidnapping, two counts of common assault and two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mthunzi was found guilty of two counts of kidnapping, two counts of common assault and two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. They were both acquitted of the intimidation of Buthelezi's friend Alice Manana, and defeating the ends of justice. Mdluli had a long-term relationship with Buthelezi, dating back to his school days. During her relationship with him, she met Ramogibe and they began a relationship. They eventually got married on July 22, 1998. Between 1997 and 1999, Mdluli allegedly went to extreme lengths to track down Buthelezi and Ramogibe. Mdluli and Mthunzi allegedly kidnapped and assaulted Ramogibe. He was shot dead in 1999.No one was ever convicted of Ramogibe's murder. Mdluli was accused of sabotaging the investigation.
