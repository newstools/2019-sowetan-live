The SA Revenue Service is opening its doors from 8am to 1pm on Saturdays in October 2019 to help you with the filing of your income tax returns. Assistance offered on Saturdays will be limited to the submission of personal income tax returns and helping you to register for and file on the Sars MobiApp, the taxman said in statement. You don’t have to file a return if you meet all of the following requirements: To avoid frustration, you must take the necessary supporting documents, including your banking details; IRP5/IT3(a) certificate(s); certificates [IT3(b)] that you received for any investment income; medical aid certificate for details of medical aid contributions made that do not appear on your IRP5/IT3(a) certificate(s); retirement annuity contribution certificates; details of business travel and information about foreign tax credits withheld. Other relevant documents include completed confirmation of diagnosis of disability form (ITR-DD), if applicable; and financial statements, if applicable for business income. The closing dates for filing personal income tax returns are 31 October for provisional and non-provisional taxpayers who file at a branch; 4 December for non-provisional taxpayers who use eFiling or the Sars MobiApp; and 31 January for provisional taxpayers who use eFiling.
