Cameron is an alumnus of the university and received an honorary doctorate from the institution in 2015. He was elected by an overwhelming majority at a meeting made up of members of the university's council‚ executive committee of the senate‚ and the president and vice-president of the Stellenbosch University convocation‚ the university said in a statement. "I am honoured and humbled to have this chance to serve [Stellenbosch University] and its communities‚ and look forward to my new tasks‚" Cameron said. Prof Wim de Villiers‚ rector and vice-chancellor‚ said: "It is a privilege to have someone of the stature of Judge Edwin Cameron as chancellor of the university. He is a champion for human rights and boasts a distinguished legal career. I look forward to working with him. "We also thank our current chancellor‚ Dr Johann Rupert‚ for his hard work and assistance during his term‚ which ends on December 31."
