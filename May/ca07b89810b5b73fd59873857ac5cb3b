A 102-year-old French woman allegedly confessed to murdering her 92-year-old neighbour at a retirement home in France. The woman, whose identity has been withheld, was taken to a psychiatric hospital after the attack. BBC reports that the woman told one of her caregivers at the home in Ch√©zy-sur-Marne that she had "killed someone". The victim's body was found with a severely bruised face. A postmortem revealed that she died of "strangulation and blows to the head". According to the prosecutor, at the time of her alleged confession the woman was "in a very agitated state". The suspect will undergo a psychological examination.
