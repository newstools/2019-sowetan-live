The BBC has fired a British radio presenter who tweeted an image of a chimpanzee dressed in clothes below the caption "Royal Baby leaves hospital". Meghan, wife of Prince Harry, gave birth in the early hours of Monday morning to a baby boy, Archie, the first mixed race child to be born into a senior position in British royalty in recent history. "Just got fired," Danny Baker, a broadcaster with BBC Radio 5 Live, said on Twitter. The BBC also reported the news. A spokesman for the BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
