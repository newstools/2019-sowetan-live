"We are reeling from this tragic news," the organisation's Eastern Cape provincial executive Hope Bambiso said in a statement, in which he condemned the scourge of gender-based violence. "Statistics show that three women die at the hands of their intimate partner every day in SA. This is unacceptable. We are offering our support to the family of our dear colleague, and will fiercely honour her memory through our continued work to eradicate gender-based violence from our daily lives," he vowed. Bambiso said his slain colleague had played a vital role in ensuring access to justice for awaiting-trial prisoners and incarcerated people, and was "well known as a helpful and reliable face of the justice system in the prisons".
