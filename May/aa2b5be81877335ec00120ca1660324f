Baroka coach Wedson Nyirenda is more than just a coach for the Limpopo side. He is a motivational speaker and a pastor with the Pentecostal Christian group. Nyirenda says it's  important for him to double up as a preacher for his players. "First and foremost, we preach the word of God to the players not to win a game, but to win their souls - to better their lives," said the Zambian. The former Kaizer Chiefs striker pointed out that he's seen, over the years, players lose their way and end up in a destitute state. Nyirenda wants to ensure that none of the Bakgaga players follow that path. "I've seen it and experienced it in my life. I was a football player and now I'm a coach. "You cannot just be a coach, do some exercises and then the players just go [home] . you must have a word [of God] with the players that will change their lives. This is what we do in every camp," he said. "We have 30-45 minutes and we preach life into them." The 52-year-old Nyirenda is  a strict disciplinarian who guided Baroka to their Telkom Knockout triumph  in his first season with the club.
