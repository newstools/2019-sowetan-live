And although you should always consult your doctor before beginning any exercise (or diet) programme, we are sure Boity is definitely one to listen to if you want to start working on your summer body.  I know it’s a lot but I know you are up to it. It’s not essential to be a member of a gym. Sometimes my schedule didn’t allow me to get to a gym, whilst at other times I worked out five times a week with a personal trainer. I’ve always chosen to use whatever was available to activate my goals. Choose hills for a challenge to really shed the kilos. Go cycling. These are great activities to increase your metabolism. You can also try a 20-minute low intensity workout daily and as you get fitter, increase the time and intensity of the exercise to improve your stamina and reach your weight loss target. You don’t necessarily have to exhaust yourself. A good fast-paced walk around the block also burns calories beautifully. You can easily lose almost 500 calories with half an hour of skipping. Resistance exercises tone, shape and build muscle while breaking down fats. Don’t be afraid to train with weights. You will not get too big and will add those sexy lines you always dreamed of. It will improve your muscle fitness and lift your spirits.
