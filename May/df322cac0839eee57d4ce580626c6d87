Former president Jacob Zuma says he does not anticipate any upsets in the 2019 general elections. Zuma told journalists on Wednesday that South Africans should expect this year's results to be dominated by the three big parties: the ANC, DA and EFF. "I am confident things will happen the way everybody expects. Big parties will be in the front, smaller ones will follow. It's a question of what is the distance between the big and small," said Zuma. The former president was in a joyful mood, despite admitting to suffering from a bout of flu just after he cast his vote at Ntolwane Primary School in his home village of kwaNxamalala on Wednesday. Zuma congratulated South Africa on holding a peaceful election. "Even during the campaigns, there were no major incidences reported. People are beginning to understand what democracy is. It's not war but a competition of which party leads," he said. He said in the months leading up to voting day, many described this day as one of the most important days in the history of South Africa. He lauded the "mature democracy". "Voting seems to be a big business in many parties. Many parties have emerged, more than the ones that were there before, which indicates interests, which is how democracy works," he said. However, he said news media did not do enough to educate voters by interrogating politicians on their policies, but instead allowed sloganeering to go unchallenged. "The vote is very important because you must put your vote where you know there will be benefits, improvement of the country - not just because people are shouting better slogans, but which party says it will deliver a better South Africa, better than others. That is one thing in my observation that was lacking in this campaign," said Zuma. He added that he was "very happy that I have cast my vote in my station" and promised that he made no mistake at the ballot box and voted to his party, the ANC. Journalists were not allowed to ask Zuma questions.
