The DA's Gwen Ngwenya will not return to parliament. "I have decided not to take up my seat in the 6th Parliament," she tweeted on Thursday. "Before policy development I worked in fintech (financial technology), and Iâ€™d like to work now on issues at the nexus of tech and public policy." Ngwenya previously served as head of policy for the DA and she was a member of the Standing Committee on Finance in the fifth parliament. In January, she suddenly quit the policy role, a decision prompted by differences with the party leadership over black economic empowerment, according to reports at the time. In her message to the incoming MPs, Nwenya said: "There are great people who will be on those benches, and I wish the DA a successful term." Ngwenya is also former COO of think-tank the Institute of Race Relations.
