British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday announced she will step down as Conservative leader on June 7 after failing to convince MPs to support her Brexit deal. "It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit," May said in a statement outside her Downing Street residence.
