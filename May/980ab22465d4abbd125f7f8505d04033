Johannesburg City manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni on Tuesday told the Alexandra inquiry that by receiving the memorandum from the community, the City showed its intention to resolve service delivery problems in the township. Lukhwareni was giving testimony on the second day of the inquiry being held at the offices of SA Humans Right Commission in Braamfontein. The inquiry, set up in partnership with the public protector's office, is aimed at understanding the social and economic conditions of people living in Alexandra, and factors that led to violent protests in the run up to the elections. On water and sanitation problems in Alexandra, Lukhwareni said the informal areas in the township were provided with basic water and sanitation services. "Water is supplied through standpipes placed at strategic points and sanitation services are provided via chemical toilets. However the challenge experienced with standpipes is that it is prone to vandalism by some community members," Lukhwareni said. He said there were 1,175 chemical toilets that are serviced on average twice a week and the current ratio is 1 toilet to 11 households per average. He said the problem to provide more toilets relate to the density of the area as it is only possible to place toilets at the edge of the settlements since space to access certain areas was insufficient due to congested manner the dwellings had built. With regard to waste management, Alexandra is supoosed to be serviced by 280 workers but due to human resource shortfall, it is serviced with only 205 employees, Lukhwareni added.
