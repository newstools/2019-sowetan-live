She will take over from Baleka Mbete on Wednesday. Here's what you need to know about Modise. Serving in parliament No stranger to parliament, Modise served as chairperson of the portfolio committee on defence and the joint standing committee on defence, before being elected on May 22 2014 as chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). Farm of "horror" In July 2014‚ the NSPCA obtained a warrant to inspect animals on a farm in the North West province belonging to Modise. This after the organisation received a tip-off that animals on the property had been abandoned. Andries Venter, inspector in the National SPCA's farm animals' unit, said it was the worst case of farm animal cruelty he had seen in 20 years with the NSPCA. The NSPCA found 79 dead animals, including 58 pigs. It managed to save 30 sheep and goats, nine geese and 16 chickens. Animal cruelty charges In April, AfriForum's private prosecution unit said it was ready to take Modise to trial on behalf of the NSPCA  for animal abuse. She is expected to appear in the Potchefstroom Regional Court on June 21. Twitter reactions to Modise's new position:
