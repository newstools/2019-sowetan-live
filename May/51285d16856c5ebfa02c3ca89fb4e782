Martha Ngoye, who is the agency's head of legal, risk and compliance and Tiro Holele, Prasa's executive in the office of the group CEO, have been placed on special leave. "This decision follows the outcomes and ongoing investigations that have dogged Prasa of improper, irregular, corrupt, fruitless and wasteful expenditure by various employees of Prasa at all levels of the organisation," said the group. "The suspension and placement on special leave of these executives is to ensure a fair process based on a principle of innocent until proven guilty." The decision follows a number of senior staff members on special leave or suspension this year where the agency has lost millions in the form of irregular expenditure and allegations of corruption. In March, it placed company secretary Lindikaya Zide, chief information officer Chris Mbatha and CEO of Prasa corporate real estate solutions Tara Ngubane on special leave, while it suspended Matome Mohube, its general manager of enterprise risk. In late April, it terminated Mohube's contract after he was found guilty on a number of charges.
