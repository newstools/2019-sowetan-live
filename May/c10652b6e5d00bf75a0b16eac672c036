Gauteng police have launched a manhunt for the man who failed to appear in court for his alleged involvement of the murder of a Pretoria student who was pushed from the seventh floor of a Sunnyside block of flats. Police spokesperson Cpt Daniel Mavimbela said the 37-year-old Obienna Greg Ofdegbuliwe was out on bail of R3,000. Ofdegbuliwe absconded his March 15 and 29 scheduled appearances. Mavimbela said the 23-year-old student and a friend was lured to the "notorious" Tamboti block of flats in Sunnyside through a online sale of a luxury camera earlier in May 2018. He said the friend managed to escape, but the student was pushed through a window from the seventh floor after they discovered it was a trap. Ofdegbuliwe was previously arrested after a five-month manhunt. Mavimbela said police would "leave no stone unturned" to make sure he is re-arrested.
