A 63-year-old male suspect from Lebowakgomo, Limpopo, was arrested for allegedly murdering his 35-year-old son. The man will appear in the Lebowakgomo magistrate's court after he was arrested on Tuesday. The deceased, who was staying with his parents on the same premises, has been identified as Madimetja John Ledwaba. “The police were called to a house at Ga-Ledwaba village outside Lebowakgomo at about 06:00 and, on arrival, they found the body of the deceased lying in the yard between the family house and the back rooms. “Preliminary investigations led the police to a possible murder weapon, a bloodstained axe, which was found a few metres from the body. Further investigations led to the arrest of the deceased’s father,” said police spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. The father and his son were apparently drinking liquor together in the back room on Monday night and the deceased’s body was discovered by his mother on Tuesday morning. The provincial commissioner of Limpopo police, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, condemned the incident and urged the investigators to dig deep to unearth the circumstances leading up to the  murder.
