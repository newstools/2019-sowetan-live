Pickpocketing is common in SA, but it seldom happens during casual conversation. CCTV footage captured a man appearing to pickpocket an elderly man's cellphone during a conversation. The incident was quick and almost unnoticeable. The two were walking down the passage of a shopping centre in Benoni. The alleged "thief’’ appears to be patting the shoulder of the elderly man, while chatting as a way of distracting him, and apparently taking his phone. Police say they are unaware of the incident.
