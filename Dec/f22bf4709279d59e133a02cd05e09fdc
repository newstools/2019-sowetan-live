Vladimir Putin was named acting president on Dec. 31, 1999, by then-president Boris Yeltsin. He has been in office as president or prime minister ever since, a period spanning two decades.

In the following weeks, bombings of apartment blocks across Russia kill more than 300 people, in attacks Putin blames on Chechen militants. His popularity is boosted by his tough response, which includes the aerial bombing of parts of Chechnya and an assault to recapture the breakaway southern province. Some Kremlin critics question if Chechen militants were really behind the apartment bombings. Dec. 31, 1999 - An ailing Yeltsin resigns and names Putin acting president.

Putinâ€™s image suffers a jolt after he comments on the crisis only after four days. 2002 - Chechen militants take more than 800 people hostage at a Moscow theatre.
