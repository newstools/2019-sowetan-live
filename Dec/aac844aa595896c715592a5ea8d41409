The suspects linked to the theft of 19 R4 automatic rifles from a SA National Defence Force (SANDF) army base in Pretoria earlier this week are scheduled to appear in a military court on Friday. This is according to SA National Defence Union (Sandu) national secretary Pikkie Greeff, who tweeted that the suspects would bring a bail application. Earlier this week, he said military police had arrested four suspects. All the stolen weapons were recovered in Hammanskraal on Tuesday. The SANDF said in a statement on Tuesday that the weapons were stolen duringÂ  a break-in at Lyttelton Tek Base's Engineering Formation.
