Parties supporting outgoing Democratic Republic of Congo president Joseph Kabila won a majority in the national assembly in long-delayed legislative elections, according to an AFP tally of results released early Saturday by the electoral commission. Pro-Kabila parties had passed the 250-seat threshold required to secure a majority in the 500-seat assembly, according to the tally based on information from the Independent National Election Commission (CENI).
