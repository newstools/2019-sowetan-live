A number of ANC leaders have gathered in KwaZulu-Natal since last week to attend a number of events. Some NEC members, including Gwede Mantashe, also paid a visit to community members to encourage them to register for voting and attend the events the party has planned throughout the week. However Mantasheâ€™s visit to a poverty stricken family in Nkandla was met with a lot of dismay. In a video posted on his official Twitter account, Mantashe was seen donating two plastic bags of school uniform to a pupil who lives in a mud house, this did not sit well with a lot people. Some questioned why a ruling party was, in the first place, donating goods to people they should already be providing services to. Others said they were shocked at how Mantashe was proud to visit a family living in a mud house to donate a few plastic bags. The timing of the donation also came into question.
