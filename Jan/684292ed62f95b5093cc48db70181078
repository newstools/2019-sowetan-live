After joining National First Division (NFD) strugglers Witbank Spurs, ex-Bafana Bafana mentor Shakes Mashaba is eager to invalidate popular theory that he's not cut out for club coaching. It's Mashaba's first coaching job since he was fired by SA Football Association (Safa) as Bafana tactician late in 2016. The former Swaziland national team mentor's deal runs until the end of the season. "It is most unfortunate that people say I have not had an impact at club level. I have a big impact. I coached Manning Rangers and Free State Stars, I brought them back onto the map," said Mashaba. Spurs are rooted at the bottom of the NFD table. Mashaba appears to be enjoying the new challenge. He guided the Emalahleni, Mpumalanga club to a 1-0 away win to Maccabi at the weekend, in his second match in charge. "Of course people say why join a relegation-threatened team? But there must be someone who takes that team out of the relegation zone. It's still a hell of a task but I like it," noted Mashaba, who lost 2-1 at home to Cape Umoya in his first match a fortnight ago. "There are good players in this team. They are more than capable of moving this team away from where it is. If we could win another five games, then we will be able to breath."
