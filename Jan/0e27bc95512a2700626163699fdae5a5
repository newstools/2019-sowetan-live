"Jesus of Nazareth get these devils out of here‚" a group of women screamed as they threw warm "holy" water on police using bolt cutters to free a young man from the chains church members had allegedly used to tether him to a tyre. This bizarre scene played out in the yard of St John's Church in Motherwell in the Eastern Cape shortly after a HeraldLIVE team stumbled upon the 20-year-old man in chains. Police efforts later to free Songezo Ntiyantiya from his chains took a rather comical turn when a handful of women – some still in their church gear – pitched up with buckets of warm water‚ which they flung at "the devils and intruders". The church members claimed he had been put in chains because he was a drug addict with violent tendencies. One church official said: "He is a clever guy‚ but when he smokes he gets violent and breaks everything in the house."
