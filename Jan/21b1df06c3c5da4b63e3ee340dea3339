It is understood that the boy had been swimming with friends near the pier on North beach when he disappeared beneath the surf. It is thought that he was caught in a rip current. Lifeguards were alerted by the boy’s companions and began searching for the boy‚ calling for the assistance of the specialised police search and rescue unit.
