"Meanwhile, in the Mokwakwaila policing area outside Tzaneen, the body of 24-year-old Billy Masale Ramokgopa was retrieved  after he allegedly slipped into Molototsi river while on his way  home with a friend from a local liquor outlet," Ngoepe said. Police said in another incident, they  retrieved the body of 33-year-old Thinavhudzulo Ramadzhiela of Tshitomboni village in the Thohoyandou policing area.
