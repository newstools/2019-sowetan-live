Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has indicated that the club is looking to reinforce the squad with a striker in this January transfer window. The Brazilians have been uncharacteristically quiet during this period where there are two weeks remaining before the window closes. The club is looking for an additional option in the striker department with Jeremy Brockie not scoring consistently enough while Ali Meza and Toni Silva are struggling to make an impact. "It would be nice to get a strong one [striker] to add more power when I substitute Brockie," Mosimane said. "There's a nice one I like there somewhere in KZN but his coach has already warned me. Teams at this point don't want to release their players. "Sometimes all you can do is to make deals for the end of the season because right now it's a struggle to get players to be released." At KZN clubs Golden Arrows, Maritzburg United and AmaZulu there aren't too many strikers who are firing on all cylinders. While Mosimane did not name him, all indications point to in-form Argentinian Emiliano Tade at AmaZulu. Tade has scored six goals in all 18 competition games for Usuthu and has contributed two assists. He has been an instrumental figure for the team this season since his arrival in July.
