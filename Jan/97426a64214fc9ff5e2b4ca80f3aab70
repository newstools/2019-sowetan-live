Lawyers for Mozambique's former finance minister Manuel Chang will challenge the lawfulness of Chang's detention in South Africa, they said in a Johannesburg court on Tuesday. Chang, who was detained in South Africa last week over his alleged involvement in a fraud involving $2 billion (R27.78 billion) in loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique, denies wrongdoing.
