Police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said the men were attending a New Year's celebration at a village in Centane in the Eastern Cape. Manatha said the man is believed to have asked him why he was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. "The suspect became angry and stabbed the deceased in his upper body‚" he said. The victim‚ 22‚ was rushed to Butterworth Hospital in a car but was declared dead on arrival. His alleged killer is expected to appear in the Centane Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.
