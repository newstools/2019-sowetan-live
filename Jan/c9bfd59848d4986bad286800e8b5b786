The political future of the KwaZulu-Natal ANC’s deputy leader Mike Mabuyakhulu, who was being touted as a possible premier candidate in the province, is in the balance as pressure relating to a graft case against him builds. Mabuyakhulu, along with former premier Senzo Mchunu, were at the forefront of Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign ahead of the ANC’s national elective conference in December 2017. Ramaphosa took over the leadership of the ANC  and promised to clean up the government and the party. Mabuyakhulu’s legal woes could put a spanner in the works of the president’s anti-graft efforts. He has served as  MEC in  different portfolios since 1999 and has been touted as possible premier of the province after the widely expected retirement of premier Willies Mchunu due to ill health. On Thursday morning the Asset Forfeiture Unit  swooped  on Mabuyakhulu and seven  co-accused in his corruption case, attaching their property and cars. Mabuyakhulu and his co-accused have made several appearances in  Durban’s commercial crime court facing charges of money laundering and corruption relating to R28m allegedly paid for the North Sea Jazz Festival in Durban in 2012. The festival never took place. The state alleges that the accused shared the money  earmarked for the  concert among themselves.
