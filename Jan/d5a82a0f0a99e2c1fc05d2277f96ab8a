Orlando Pirates coach Milutin "Micho" Sredojevic has conceded that the Buccaneers' defensive fragility is a cause for concern, vowing they are working tirelessly as they seek improvement. While they've undoubtedly thrown their name in the hat for the league title, Pirates' leaky defence is constantly proving to be their only weakest link thus far. They may be second on the log behind Bidvest Wits, but Bucs have kept only seven clean sheets in their 26 matches across all competitions this term. "We are conceding and this is a concern that we need to address as a team. It is our dream to have clean sheets,'' said Sredojevic of his charges, who have conceded 24 goals in all competitions so far this season. "We have a problem and we are not running away from it.'' Sredojevic was thrilled that they have scored six goals in their last two games against Highlands Park and Chippa United respectively, but again, the Pirates mentor knows that their goal-scoring ability is tainted by their poor defensive record. Pirates will face Zimbabwean champions FC Platinum in their first group match of the CAF Champions League in Bulawayo on Saturday (3pm SA time). Sredojevic feels their past two league outings helped them to prepare for this encounter. "It is never easy after the festive season to restart the engine. We had those two matches and I believe those two matches are a perfect preparation for the match that we are having in Bulawayo on Saturday.''
