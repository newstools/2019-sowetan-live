The Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) have effectively banned its officers and ordinary soldiers from marrying each other - and this includes those already married. ZDF comprises of the Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) and the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), both under the command of general Philip Valerio Sibanda. In an internal circular dated January 18 2019, which came into effect on February 1, Sibanda said the "Fraternisation Policy" was to avoid violation of “good order and military discipline".

Failure to do so also carries a penalty of both being fired from the army. In future, marriage between soldiers is outlawed. “Those that will breach the policy after its promulgation will be discharged forthwith according to the policy,” the army commander said. In 2013, Nester Chidembo and Emmanuel Masendeke, both serving in the army at the time, were dismissed after Chidembo had fallen pregnant before the expiry of a three-year probation. They took their matter to the High Court citing illegal expulsion. The matter is still before the courts.
