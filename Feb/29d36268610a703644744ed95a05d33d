There was mixed reaction on social media after the ANC issued a public apology to public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan and the party’s head of organising, Senzo Mchunu, for criticising the two on comments they made about black engineers.The two were attacked by the ANC in a statement on Wednesday for allegedly making comments which “were neither warranted nor acceptable” about black engineers at Eskom.Gordhan demanded an apology, which the ANC issued on Thursday. “The African National Congress, following a thorough investigation on statements attributed to both minister of public enterprises Cde Pravin Gordhan and the ANC head of organising, Cde Senzo Mchunu, has established that their remarks were taken out of context.”According to TimesLive, the apology came after Gordhan sent a letter to ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, in which he demanded   the statement be retracted and  the ANC spokesperson  issue a public apology. Gordhan’s demand for an apology was not well received by many, who questioned his role and power within the ruling party.
