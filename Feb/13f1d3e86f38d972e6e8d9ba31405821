Social media was in tatters after a video of the infamous Pastor Alph Lukau resurrected a dead man using his 'supernatural powers' on Sunday in Johannesburg. In the video, a man named Elliot is seen lying in a coffin, dressed in a white suit and surrounded by his supposedly inconsolable family who claim he had been dead for three days. A woman, who is said to be his landlord, said that the man started coughing on Friday and died in her arms. This is not the first time the pastor made headlines, in 2014 the City of JohannesburgÂ obtained an interdict ordering a halt to construction activity at the Alleluia Ministries International church in Lyndhurst. He also held a conference for women seeking marriage proposals in 2016, charging them R5,000 to anoint their ring fingers. Another video shows the 'resurrected' man having his first meal. In response to this viral video one tweep started the Resurrection Challenge by posting a video of a man imitating the resurrection. The resurrection has also received criticism from social media users.
