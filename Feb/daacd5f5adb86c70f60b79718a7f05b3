Former ANC member of parliament Vytjie Mentor's cross-examination continued at the Zondo commission on Tuesday. Mentor has been cross-examined at the inquiry on a testimony she gave before the commission in August‚ with the inquiry presenting evidence which has revealed various inconsistencies with Mentor's testimony. Mentor was cross-examined by lawyers of cooperative governance and traditional affairs chief operations officer Lakela Kaunda. In her previous testimony‚ Mentor said that she had received a call from Kaunda informing her that her request to meet with then-president Jacob Zuma to discuss pebble bed modular nuclear reactors was granted. Through her lawyers‚ Kaunda denied that she had called Mentor to set up a meeting between her and Zuma in October 2010. Mentor changed her testimony‚ saying the call between her and Kaunda may have taken place in September instead. On Tuesday‚ Mentor accused the inquiry of being biased against her evidence and centering the cross-examination on not corroborating her evidence. "Whatever has corroborated my evidence so far has never been put to me. I felt like throughout the process I have been cross-examined‚ this is what I have experienced and this is what I feel ... Nothing that corroborated my evidence has been brought forward and I think that's an imbalance‚" she told the commission. This happened after Mentor was cross-examined on Monday and Tuesday by advocate Mahlape Sello on claims she made in her 2018 testimony before the commission. -TMG Digital
