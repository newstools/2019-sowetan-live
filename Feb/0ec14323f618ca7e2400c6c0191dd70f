Stuart Baxter needs to engage Safa president Danny Jordaan if he wants the association to engage Kaizer Chiefs on the availability Shaun Bartlett as Bafana Bafana assistant-coach for next month’s qualifier against Libya. This was the view of Jordaan this week‚ who said that Bafana coach Baxter has yet to approach the South Africa Football Association president regarding Bartlett being roped in again for the huge final 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Bafana must draw against Libya in the away Group E fixture on the weekend of March 22 to 24 – to be played either in Tunisia or Egypt – to reach Afcon 2019. Bartlett was brought in as a second assistant to Molefi Ntseki in South Africa’s previous match‚ the 1-1 draw against Nigeria at FNB Stadium in November. However the former Charlton Athletic striker has since joined Kaizer Chiefs as an assistant to their head coach Ernst Middendorp‚ and it is unclear whether he will be able to serve as on the Bafana technical staff again against Libya. “It’s his [Baxter’s] choice. If he asks‚ we will certainly give him whatever support we can‚” Jordaan said. “He must decide whether he wants Shaun and we will do whatever is necessary. “I did see Shaun in Port Elizabeth‚ because they [Chiefs] played there [in the Nedbank Cup against the Magic FC last weekend].” Asked if he had engaged Bartlett then at all on the Bafana matter‚ Jordaan said: “No‚ no. I can’t.” Nigeria have qualified for Afcon 2019 – to be held in Egypt in June and July – as Group E leaders with 10 points‚ with Seychelles left to play at home. South Africa are on nine points and Libya on seven.
