Members of political factions brought a halt to an eNCA live broadcast in Polokwane after they began fighting over which political party deserved to be interviewed about the murder of Thoriso Themane. eNCA news anchor Lindokuhle Xulu was drowned out by the community outside of the Polokwane Magistrateâ€™s Court as he tried to report on the events that were unfolding. A visibly enraged man wearing ANC regalia shouted at Xulu and waved a finger in his face accusing him of being biased for speaking to the EFF. An argument ensued where the reporter denied that he was being biased. The apparent ANC members told Xulu to leave the area after they could not come to an agreement.
