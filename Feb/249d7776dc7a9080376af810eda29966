Mamelodi Sundowns' number one goalkeeper Denis Onyango is contemplating quitting Uganda's Cranes in order to prolong his club career. Capped 67 times for his national team, Onyango's club coach Pitso Mosimane said he had heard from the other goalkeepers at Sundowns that the goalie wants to bring an end to his international career to focus on the Brazilians. Onyango, who turns 34 in May, has penned a new four-year deal with Sundowns and because of continuous niggling injuries, he is said to be considering quitting Uganda. "I heard a little bit from the other keepers that probably the [2019 Africa] Cup of Nations would be his last," Mosimane said this week. Uganda are one of the nations that have already qualified for the tournament to be hosted by Egypt from June to July. In their Afcon qualifying campaign and with one match to spare, Uganda have kept five clean sheets with Onyango in goal in all the matches in Group L, which also has Lesotho, Tanzania and Cape Verde Islands. At club level, the former SuperSport United, Mpumalanga Black Aces and Bidvest Wits keeper has been a regular for Sundowns for the past four seasons, continuing to play ahead of Zambian international Kennedy Mweene and more recently Reyaad Pieterse and Thela Ngobeni. Onyango couldn't be reached for comment. He is injured and missed last night's Absa Premiership match against Cape Town City.
