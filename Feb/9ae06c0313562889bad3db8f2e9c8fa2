A series of explosions was heard in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Saturday, just hours before the opening of polls in presidential and parliamentary elections. Multiple blasts were heard at about 6:00 am (0500 GMT), locals told AFP. There was no immediate indication of the cause but the city has been repeatedly attacked by Boko Haram Islamists.
