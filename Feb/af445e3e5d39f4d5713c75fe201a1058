Eskom said there was a risk of stage 1 load-shedding from 2pm to 10pm on Thursday. The power utility said the load-shedding was as a result of a shortage of generating capacity. On Wednesday evening‚ Eskom warned that the power system remained tight and said it was possible that it could lose additional power-generating units. On Wednesday evening‚ it requested customers to use electricity sparingly. Eskom said load-shedding was done countrywide as a controlled option to respond to unplanned events to protect the electricity power system from a total blackout. Stage 1 allows for up to 1‚000MW of the national load to be shed. "While the risk remains high‚ load-shedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. We remind customers that load-shedding is a controlled measure which protects the power system from a total collapse or blackout‚" Eskom said in a statement. Eskom encouraged customers to continue to use electricity sparingly. "Please switch off geysers‚ pool pumps as well as all nonessential lighting and electric appliances to assist in reducing demand." - TMG Digital
