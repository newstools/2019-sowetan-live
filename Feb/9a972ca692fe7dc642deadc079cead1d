South Africa Under-20 starlet Nkosingiphile Ngcobo is not losing sleep on being promoted to Kaizer Chiefs’ senior team and says he would prefer to let his work on the field to do the talking for him. The versatile Pietermaritzburg-born attacking midfielder was one of the Amajita players who shone at the recently-concluded Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations in Niger‚ where he was also included in Africa’s U-20 XI. Thabo Senong’s team finished third and qualified for the second successive Fifa U-20 World Cup to be played in Poland in May. “My job is to continue working hard and keep focused because I know my time [at Chiefs] will come‚” said Ngcobo of his prospects at Chiefs‚ where he has been given time to train with the first team. “The coach [Ernst Middendorp] is always telling me to focus and work hard and my time will come.” Chiefs recently began to field another promoted youngster‚ Happy Mashiane (21)‚ in their first team and Ngcobo (19) has been mentioned as one of the next in line as Amakhosi look to their youngsters as they aim for a revival as they near an unprecedented four-year trophy drought. On winning a place in Africa’s best U-20 XI‚ Ngcobo credited his teammates and the technical team for supporting him. “It motivates me a lot but I want to thank everyone involved in my team because I didn’t do it alone‚” he said. “To be in Africa’s best XI is because my teammates were always supporting and we worked as a team. “As Amajita we had a great tournament in Niger and we really wanted to qualify for the World Cup. “So even in the World Cup we want to improve from what we did in 2017. I do believe there will be vast improvement that everyone will see in our team.” Amajita beat Nigeria on penalties in the third/fourth-place playoff in Niger‚ having lost 1-0 against eventual runners-up Senegal in the semifinals. Mali won the tournament.
