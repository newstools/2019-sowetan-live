Police have arrested three men and a woman after they were found in possession of firearms and ammunition. The men were arrested during an intelligence-driven operation by the police's trio task team from Ekurhuleni East on Tuesday morning. Police spokesperson captain Mavela Masondo said a shotgun, which was recovered from a man in KwaThema, was believed to have been stolen during a business robbery in the area on February 9. On February 14, police foiled a robbery at a chain store in Tsakane and recovered two firearms which were stolen from two police officers the previous day. Masondo said the R5 rifle was "outstanding". Further investigation led them to Tsakane in Ekurhuleni, where they arrested two other men and a woman. They were found in possession of an R5 and ammunition which was stolen from a police officer earlier this month. Masondo could not immediately confirm if the suspects were linked to the robbery at the Limpopo Arms and Ammunition shop on the East Rand on February 13. "Further investigations will be conducted by police to determine whether the arrested suspects are linked to the robberies of February 9 and 13, and for possible linkage to other serious and violent crimes in Ekurhuleni and surrounding areas," Masondo said.
