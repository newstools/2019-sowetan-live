Amajita assistant coach Helman Mkhalele has assured that SA are not going to the Fifa Under-20 World Cup to add to the numbers. He was speaking after they were drawn against powerhouses in Argentina, Portugal and Korea DPR in Group F. Amajita booked their World Cup spot by finishing third in the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Niger two weeks ago. SA will open their World Cup campaign in Poland against Argentina on May 25. "You cannot say our group is tough because this is a World Cup and there are no easy games. We are going there to compete, the plan is to advance through the group stages," said Mkhalele. "We must beat Argentina in the opener. that would set the tone for us. We've started analysing them and the other two nations in Portugal and Korea. For me, I think the trickiest country to face in our group is Portugal because they like to keep the ball like us." Mkhalele, who represented SA in the 1998 World Cup with Bafana Bafana in France, has promised that they will select the strongest possible squad to represent the country in Poland. "We are very blessed with talent in SA. We are going to take a very strong team to Poland. Players must just raise their hands. As coach Thabo Senong [Amajita's head coach] always says, the door is always open in the national team," stated Mkhalele. Despite winning bronze in Niger, Amajita were not convincing throughout the Afcon tournament. Mkhalele has vowed they will improve in the World Cup. "We did not have some of our best players in Niger, but we were gallant. "In the World Cup we will be even better because I think we will get all the players we need, people like Lyle Foster [who was not released by his French club Monaco for Afcon] should be available."
