Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic has shed some light on the recent reinstatement of goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands to the starting XI. After a costly blunder against Highlands Park in the league opener in August last year, Sandilands lost his berth in the Bucs line-up. The 35-year-old shot-stopper made an unexpected return to the starting line-up in Bucs' 0-0 home draw against Esperance in the CAF Champions League. Since then, Sandilands has been rather impressive, playing five games, keeping one clean sheet and conceding five times. "Looking at Sandilands, there've been many questions. But we are having a present situation that in backing all our four goalkeepers, he's the first in line. We have, purely on merit, taken him back into starting line-up," said Sredojevic. "Yes, it was risky [to restore Sandilands to the team] . I remember how many questions came before the derby regarding putting him in such a match. "However, he proved that he had also gone the bridge of MDC [MultiChoice Diski Challenge], where it was like a rehabilitation process. In training he has been wonderful . since that Highlands Park blunder." Pirates put in one of their best performances in recent months when they dispatched AmaZulu 4-1 at a buzzing Orlando Stadium on Saturday night. While some feel the win boosted the Soweto giants' title ambitions, Micho insists it's still too early for title talk. "We are having a totally different approach. There's still too much to play for. The rest of the things we have no right to think about. "We got what we wanted against AmaZulu but we have to remain firmly grounded. Our focus now is on Golden Arrows."
