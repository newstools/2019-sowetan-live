A Durban woman accused of dumping her newborn baby down a stormwater drain was granted R5‚000 bail in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Baby Sibanisethu‚ named by the community‚ was plucked from the drain in Newlands East in a dramatic four-hour rescue two weeks ago. Her mother‚ who is facing a charge of attempted murder‚ was arrested in hospital last week. On Wednesday‚ the public gallery of Court B was packed with the women's family and friends. The 32-year-old mother of three stepped into the dock dressed in a grey sweater with a slogan "Vote for Girls" and a pair of blue jeans. She appeared withdrawn and pale as her bail application got under way. State prosecutor Seema Reddy did not oppose her bid for bail. Defence attorney Jacques Botha asked the court to prohibit the media from photographing or filming her because of the sensitive nature of the case. Magistrate Ravi Pillay granted the defence's request. - TMG Digital
