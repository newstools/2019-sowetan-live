A baby girl was born on a sidewalk in Durban on Friday afternoon. Private security company Marshall Security received a frantic call from a client stating that a woman was giving birth on the roadside outside her home on Berkley Crescent in Durban North. "Crisis Medical paramedics responded to the scene and on arrival found a 29-year-old female in the advanced stage of labour, having just given birth to a baby girl," said Crisis Medical spokesman Kyle van Reenen. The mother and her daughter were stabilised and taken to Addington Hospital for further care. "Both mom and baby remain in a stable condition. Thank you to the vigilant resident who was able to arrange assistance needed for the mother and her baby," Van Reenen said.
