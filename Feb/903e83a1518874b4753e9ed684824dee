A Durban woman accused of dumping her baby in a stormwater drain has been transferred to Westville prison after more than a week in hospital. The 27-year-old woman‚ who cannot be named to protect the baby’s identity‚ is expected to apply for bail in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele told SowetanLIVE that the woman is currently in Westville prison. Last week the matter was set to proceed in her absence‚ but an outstanding letter confirming the woman’s presence in hospital delayed proceedings. Magistrate Ravi Pillay adjourned the case until Wednesday. The woman‚ who is facing a charge of attempted murder‚ was arrested in hospital last Monday. She remained there under police guard until her transfer to prison. The baby‚ named "Sibanisethu" (our ray of hope) by the Newlands East community‚ was plucked from a stormwater drain in a dramatic four-hour rescue two weeks ago.
