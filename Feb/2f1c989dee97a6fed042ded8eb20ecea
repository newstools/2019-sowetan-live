Modern football players all over the world usually avoid celebrating goals against their former clubs but BidVest Wits coach Gavin Hunt sees no reason why they shouldn’t. Former Wits player Phakamani Mahlambi also went against this unwritten rule and celebrated wildly after netting a goal for Mamelodi Sundowns against his erstwhile employers in an Absa Premiership clash that ended in 1-1 draw in Milpark on Saturday. “They (Sundowns) pay his wages and he can do what he likes‚” said Hunt after Mahlambi’s celebration that included flashing Sundowns’ Sky is the Limit sign to the stands. “That business of kissing badges is a lot of nonsense‚” added Hunt. “Not celebrating goals… who pays your wages? “They (Sundowns) pay his wages and he can do what he likes. We made our money (when they sold him to Al Ahly and later to Sundowns)‚ yah.” Hunt also asserted that he never believed their match against Sundowns was any close to be being a title decider‚ going as far as saying there’s still a long way to go before the end of the season. “It was no title decider‚ we’ve got nine games left‚” said the Wits coach. There were questions mark around Cole Alexander’s performance on Saturday but Hunt leapt to his central midfielder's defence‚ insisting that any player can have an off-day. “Cole has been the player of the year for us so far I think‚” he said. “He can have an off-day here and there but otherwise he’s been our best player this season‚ hands down‚ hands down.” Wits host title rivals Cape Town City at Milpark on Saturday night but they could be trailing Sundowns by then as the Brazilians face the selfsame side at Loftus Stadium on Wednesday night. Sundowns then welcome Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday before the Wits v City game.
