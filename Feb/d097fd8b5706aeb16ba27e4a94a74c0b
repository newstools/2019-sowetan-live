Why wait for Twitter to verify your account when you can simply upload a video to assure your followers that it is really you? That's what Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela has done. On Monday last week, Komphela created a Twitter account and posted for the first time. In his post, Komphela expressed concerns over rumours that there are fake accounts in his name on the platform. This post did not get much engagement from his followers, probably because even then, there was no knowing for sure that it was him. On Sunday, he posted a video in which he verified his account. In the video, Komphela can be heard saying "We're living in an era where anybody can be somebody else. We're living in an era where someone chooses to be somebody else." At the time of publishing this article the video has been liked more than 200 times and has 46 comments since it was posted less than a day ago.
