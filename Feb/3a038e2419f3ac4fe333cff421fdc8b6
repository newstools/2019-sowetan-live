The magistrate presiding over the bail hearing of rapper Thulani Ngcobo - better known as Pitch Black Afro - who is accused of killing his wife – has threatened to strike the matter off the roll. This came after a pathologist who was due to testify in Ngcobo’s matter failed to appear in the Johannesburg magistrate’s court yesterday. The Matofotofo hitmaker appeared briefly in court where he faces a charge of murder. Magistrate Piet du Plessis told the state prosecutor he would be left with no other option but to strike the matter off the roll if the state failed to secure the presence of its witnesses. “We can't have this. We cannot proceed with the matter without the witness coming to testify. If the state fails to ensure that their witnesses come to court then I’ll be forced to withdraw charges against the accused,” Du Plessis said. Du Plessis further told the state prosecutor to issue a subpoena to the pathologist instructing him to be present at the next court date. Ngcobo is facing charges of premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice after his wife, Catherine Modisane, died at a Johannesburg bed and breakfast on December 31. She sustained injuries to her upper body.
