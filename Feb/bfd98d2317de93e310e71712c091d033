A blitz on business premises in Industria‚ Johannesburg south‚ has revealed appalling conditions for workers. Dr Valencia Ntombi Khumalo‚ MMC for Group Corporate and Shared Services‚ said the inspections - with various government departments - were organised to ensure that by-law infringements are addressed. Appropriate penalties are being issued for infringements‚ she said. At one premises‚ the team shared a photograph of two beds - one just made out of wooden pallets - covered in black plastic rubbish bags as a makeshift sheet‚ with mounds of clothes scattered about. Huge piles of rubbish were in the grounds. The city also shared images of a factory which it said was breaking by-laws regarding the collection of second-hand goods and recycling. "They convert plastic into sack. A permit for recycling is required (offensive trade)." At one premises‚ the occupants seemed to have been tipped off ahead of the blitz‚ said Khumalo. "We were informed that minutes before we arrived‚ they locked themselves up. but we shall not stop ensuring the law is respected." The City of Johannesburg said its officials will coordinate with the police and the Labour Department to investigate the infringements.
