As much as he's proud of his goalkeeper Siyabonga Mbatha's impressive recent form, AmaZulu mentor Cavin Johnson feels it would be wrong of him to comment on whether his charge deserves a Bafana Bafana call-up. With recognised No1 Itumeleng Khune of Kaizer Chiefs out with a shoulder injury, Darren Keet of Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United's Ronwen Williams are the obvious choices in goal for Bafana for the all-important Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya next month. But the spot for a third shot-stopper is up for grabs ahead of the clash where Bafana only need avoid defeat to qualify for the Afcon finals in Egypt from June 21-July 19. After his top-drawer display in many of AmaZulu's matches this season, especially in the last two against Mamelodi Sundowns (a 2-0 win) and Cape Town City (where they won 1-0 after he saved a penalty), many think Mbatha is ready for national team duty. "He [Mbatha] has done it [kept a clean sheet] twice in a row but he can get better. My analysis... he's done well for this club but for me to say so and so needs to be in the national team, I think it's not good," Johnson said. "As my goalkeeper, in different situations he's performed very well... saving penalties and clear cut chances in one- versus-one moments. It's for the Bafana selectors to have a look and understand what type of game they'll play.If they need Siya [Mbatha], we always appreciate that." Mbatha, 30, has kept nine clean sheets in 17 matches he's played in so far this season, conceding 18 goals.
