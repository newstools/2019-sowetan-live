Chippa United coach Clinton Larsen has refused to be drawn into what Golden Arrows skipper Trevor Mathiane said about him - that Abafana Bes'thende played long balls under his stewardship. Larsen had spent three years at Arrows before joining Chippa early this year. Thanks to a spate of injuries, centre-back Mathiane only managed 50 games during Larsen's three-year stint. In his absence, fellow defender Nkanyiso Mngwengwe captained the side. While he has been impressed by new coach Steve Komphela, Mathiane, 30, is of the view that Larsen's style did not suit Arrows. "I think with Larsen we were not playing the way we play now with Steve Komphela. Steve is a coach who likes us to play football . Not long balls. With Larsen we were playing a lot of long balls other than football. It did not suit us," Mathiane said. Having hit the ground running at Chilli Boys by winning four of the six games he has overseen, Larsen was not keen to reply to what the Arrows skipper thinks of his philosophy. "I know nothing about what Trevor said. I am not going to pay attention to it at all. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. My focus is on Chippa," Larsen told Sowetan. "It's very important as a coach to respect everyone in the game. "I had a wonderful three years at Arrows and I will forever be thankful for the opportunity the chairperson of the club [Manto Madlala] gave me," said Larsen.
