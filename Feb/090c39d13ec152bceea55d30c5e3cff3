SuperSport United goalkeeper Ronwen Williams is optimistic that Matsatsantsa can challenge for the league title. SuperSport are fifth on the table on 32 points, six adrift of leaders Bidvest Wits. Matsatsantsa's aspirations took a knock after losing 2-1 to relegation-threatened Baroka at home at the weekend. Nevertheless, Williams is still confident that they can put up a solid fight in the run-in for the title. "We cannot stop believing that we can challenge for the league because we've got the players and the coach. We need to pick up as many points soon. "Going into the international break, the next three games will be crucial for us," said Williams. The SuperSport keeper also heaped praise on his coach Kaitano Tembo. Williams thinks that Tembo's naysayers are now eating humble pie amid SuperSport's promising recent form. "Coach Kaitano is a quality coach. He has a special bond with us as players. He works very hard to make sure that SuperSport are always on top. At the beginning of this year people were saying we must get rid of him. that was the headlines, but those people are saying nothing now." The 27-year-old keeper has been impressed by the way new signings Mxolisi Macuphu and George Lebese have gelled with the team. Macuphu has already scored two goals, while Lebese is yet to find the back of the net. "The new guys are working very hard. As you see, Macuphu is already scoring. George is also working very hard. Their arrival really strengthened the team," noted Williams, who has started all SuperSport's 21 league matches this season, keeping eight clean sheets. Before the international break, Matsatsantsa clash with Chippa United (Sunday), Free State Stars (March 10) and Kaizer Chiefs (March 15).
