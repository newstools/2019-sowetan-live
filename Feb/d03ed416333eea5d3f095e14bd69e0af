Shots have been fired on the premises of Edenvale High School in Johannesburg on Thursday during a suspected robbery. Two suspects were shot dead and a third was injured in the shootout that occurred around midday, according to paramedics on the scene. Emer-G-Med spokesperson Jurgen Kotze said the motive for the shooting appears to be a robbery attempt at the school. Last week, a pupil at Dowerglen High school in Edenvale was hospitalised after gunmenÂ  entered the school and started firing shots at random. The four men were being sought by security guards who spotted the men allegedly robbing a nearby telecommunications tower. Two were arrested at the scene while the other two fled to the school where the shots were fired. One was arrested while the fourth escaped. This is a developing story, more to come shortly
