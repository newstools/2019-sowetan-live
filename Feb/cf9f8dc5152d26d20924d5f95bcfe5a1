Ahead of his first clash against former side Golden Arrows at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium tonight (8pm), Chippa United coach Clinton Larsen doubts his knowledge of Abafana Bes'thende will count for much. Before joining Chippa in December, Larsen had spent three years at Arrows. The 48-year-old mentor has since hit the ground running at the Port Elizabeth-based side, winning four of the five matches he's overseen, with a single draw across all competitions. "Spending three years at Arrows does not give me any edge at all. Yes, I know them but Steve Komphela [his successor] also knows all my players because it's our job as coaches to profile every player in the league,'' Larsen said. "Nothing changed in our preparations. It's our home game, so we need to be strong and impose ourselves. We are expecting a difficult game because Arrows have also been getting good results.'' The Chilli Boys coach also elaborated on what he has changed since taking over from Joel Masutha. He is crediting their resurgence on defending as a unit. Under Larsen, Chippa have only conceded two goals. "The attacking players are starting to understand the importance for them to defend from the front, so we are not conceding many goals as we used to be," he said.
